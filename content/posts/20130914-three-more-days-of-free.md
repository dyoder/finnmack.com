In a related story, *Qubit* got its [first review][review]:

> Clever nerd takes hacking job and gets in too deep with nasties in India and Singapore. Depth added by the main protagonist's (the nerd again) daughter being taken hostage, and a love interest with a cia agent. The nasties could have had a little more depth, but this didn't detract from the story.
