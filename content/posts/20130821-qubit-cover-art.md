I'm excited about the new cover art. Or, as I keep mistyping it: *covert art*. [Martin Saavedra][ms]'s design is both eye-catching and intriguing, adroitly evoking a near-future tech-noir vibe, blending HCI elements from advanced usability research, Unix terminal screenshots, and the Singapore skyline. It's perfect for *Qubit*.

If you're curious about the process, we ran a contest on [99Designs]. We'd had good results with that approach in the past for other types of projects, so we figured we'd give it a shot.

What I like about the process is that you usually get several talented designers involved instead of just one. With any one designer, you sometimes hit a wall, where, for whatever reason, they just can't quite find the right vibe. Which isn't surprising at all--creativity isn't a push-button thing--but, at the end of the day, you risk being stuck with a design that doesn't match your vision.

We now have a stable of talented designers, all thanks to past contests. If you already have those resources, good for you, but we didn't. You can later run contests and only invite select designers. Sometimes I also invite people who didn't actually win because they did great work.

Many [designers dislike 99Designs][haters]. I get it. And some people haven't had as much success with it as we have. Your mileage may vary. But, as you can see from Martin's design, it can work.

One last note--this design is actually a refinement from the winning design. I kept asking Martin to try things out and he did, even after the contest was over. We added a splash of color to the winning design and that put it over the top.
