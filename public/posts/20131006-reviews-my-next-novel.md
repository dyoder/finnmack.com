[*Qubit*][qubit] continues to hold its position in the category HNR lists, but has failed to get above the fold. The top spot it's held so far is #7 (in techno-thrillers), a tantilizing one spot shy of where it needs to be. The rate of sales has increased steadily since I moved into the paid store, which is a good sign. It would be great to see some more reviews, though.

I've got a few things planned to help build awareness for the book. I'll talk about those more in upcoming posts as they develop. Up until, the only promotion I've done is to run some ads on [GoodReads][gr], which have helped build awareness on GR itself, but, as far as I can tell, haven't had much impact on sales. I think their self-serve program has a long way to go, unfortunately, and they aren't interested in doing a custom program unless you're willing to spend $5,000 or more. The ad folks there don't seem to realize that some of us might use the results from the self-serve program to evaluate the possibility for a larger ad spend. As far as I can tell, there is no way for GR to deliver enough clicks to warrant anything close to $5,000. I can't even spend $500. I have no idea what they're thinking with that.

It would be great to see more reviews before investing more in promotion, but, fortunately, I think there is still some low-hanging fruit that isn't very expensive. It's probably fair to say we're still in the experimenting stage. It's a market that is evolving rapidly, which makes it a bit tricky. What worked for someone a year ago may not work today. What will work for *Qubit* may not work for my next novel. Hopefully, we'll start to identify some strategies that work, and we'll see some strong reviews coming in to justify further investment. Also, my early experience with Amazon suggests that exposure on Amazon itself, gained with increasing sales and four- and five-star reviews, will drive sales. Which, again, is probably due to Martin's eye-catching cover art.

Speaking of my next novel, I am excited to report I'm in the early stages of working on two, actually. I haven't decided which one to do next, and I'm still throwing things at the wall to see what sticks. I'll write a bit more about these in a future post&mdash;maybe I can get some guidance from my readers as to which one I should focus on.
