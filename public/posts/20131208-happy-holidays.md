First, and foremost, I wanted to wish you all a happy holiday and thank you again for your support for [_Qubit_][qubit].

Second, by way of an update, I've run a reasonably successful promotion for _Qubit_&mdash;it broke into the top 60 for both the technothriller and hard sci-fi genres. [I'm running another one this weekend][kdn]. That's really the beginning of a mini-blitz I've got planned. I'll keep you posted on the results.

Third, I just wanted to remind you that _Qubit_ might make a great stocking stuffer, at just $2.99, for your book-nerd friends and family. Just click the [_Give as a Gift_][qubit] button and set the delivery date.

Fourth, if you've read _Qubit_ and haven't yet left a review on Amazon, [please don't forget][review]. _Qubit_ has 10 reviews so far, all four and five star reviews. But reviews are the only thing that differentiates a new author from the sea of indie ebooks competing for readers' attentions. And if you've already left a review, thank you!
