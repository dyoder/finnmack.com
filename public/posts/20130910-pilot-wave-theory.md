Science Daily recently ran [an article][sci] on a really interesting find. Basically, we can create pilot waves using ordinary fluid dynamics. The implication of this is that quantum mechanics might be a whole lot less bizarre than it first seemed.

My friend Jim in Denmark <span class="note">Not *Jim*. Not even *Jim in Denmark*. But *my friend Jim in Denmark.* This is how people ended up with those elaborate titles back in the day.</span>pointed me in the direction of this article. Until he did, I basically had no idea what the *hidden-variable theory* and/or the *de Broglie-Bohm theory* was really about. I think I probably just saw the phrase *hidden variable* and ran with it.

I always figured it was something like Kepler's mechanics, where one day Kepler says to himself, *I guess we could try this as an ellipse* and everything kind of falls into place. Einstein's skepticism had merit, if only because it seemed reasonable to suppose that perhaps we weren't really done. <span class="note">Einstein had gone through this himself with the General Theory of Relativity. Until Wolfgang Pauli invented linear algebra, there was no way to do the math.</span> But the "hidden variable" actually referred to the pilot wave.

So here we have a result coming from fluid dynamics that demonstrates how pilot waves can exist in classical physics. And pilot waves can explain what we see in quantum physics as well. As I understand it, that's really the first time we've been able to bridge those two worlds.
