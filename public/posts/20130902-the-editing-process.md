I have an editing problem. I start out thinking I'm copy-editing and then I end up making revisions. Which leads to another round of copy-editing. It's a catch-22. All you have to do is fine one thingâ€¦

What I'm trying to say here is that *Qubit* has been delayed a bit longer. The good news is that I'm not making *major* revisions. I thought about it. I thought about cutting some chapters where things slow down a bit. Maybe in a later edition. Those kind of changes are tricky and I wont' have the book until next year if I go there.
