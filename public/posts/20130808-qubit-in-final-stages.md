We're heading down the home stretch. My awesome editor, [Tammy Salyer][tammy] has finished her revisions, which I've now integrated into the manuscript, and I'm doing some last-minute rewrites. After that, there's still a lot of little things--incorporating some of the feedback I've gotten from my advisors, double-checking the dates and times, actually producing the ebook, etc.--but the actual writing process will be complete. You kind of want to celebrate. Yet, at the same time, there's still a lot of work to be done.
