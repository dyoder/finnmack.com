### 1

#### Renaissance Center (Detroit Riverfront)

#### Wednesday, January 17th

#### 2:00 p.m. EST (Eastern Standard Time)

Lock hunched his shoulders and dug his hands into his pockets, a futile defense against the whip-cold wind rushing angrily towards Jefferson Avenue from the icebound Detroit River. Dark and soaring cylinders of glass and steel loomed over him like implacable gods. Their very name--collectively, *The Renaissance Center*--was a promise of a future that had never come, a fitting monument to a city that had lost its way. 

Perhaps parking in the garage farthest from his destination was thus a fitting, if entirely accidental, ritual. After all, weren't he and the city self-similar parts of a mysterious socioeconomic fractal? Anyway, it was a costly mistake when it was twenty degrees below freezing. At last, he approached the 200 Tower, eyeing the revolving glass doors longingly. Beyond those doors lay warmth.

And a job interview.

Lock clenched his jaw at the familiar sensation of rusted gears grinding up his intestines. Why did he bother with these things? Before he even finished the thought, he knew the answer. The email inquiry had gotten his attention with those two magic words: *quantum cryptography.*

Lock found himself coming up behind a small, round figure that appeared to be wearing at least two heavy coats and three scarves, one of which secured a woolen cap, and another of which might have been a tattered blanket. A few curly white locks of hair had tumbled out from the top of this bundle, which Lock belatedly realized was an old woman. He forced himself to slow down to match her gait, reaching forward to help her push the door forward. The old woman turned back to him slowly with something that looked at first like a sneer, but after a moment, Lock realized she was trying to smile. Her face was moist with tears, perhaps from the cold. Lock nodded at her and forced himself to smile back--it was probably more of a grimace--barely restraining himself from pushing her forward towards the warmth.

With the old woman shuffling steadily forward in the wedge in front of him, Lock pushed against the door, hearing the frustrated gasp of the wind as the door sealed behind him. He paused for a moment to savor the relief—and to let the old woman get clear of the door. 

What was he still doing in cold, wintry Detroit? Why not move somewhere warmer? Somewhere he could find a decent job? Of course, he knew the answer to that question, too.

Sophie was here.

Lock made his way to an open elevator and got on, unbuttoning his coat, being careful as always with the third button, which dangled from the jacket by a single worn thread. And, as he always did, he reminded himself to take the coat to the cleaners to fix the button. He felt the gears grinding again as the floor number displayed above the door measured his ascent. 

Ten. Fifteen. Twenty.

He’d never used his real name in connection with his interest in quantum cryptography, which meant someone had gone to no small amount of trouble to find him. It wasn’t just a matter of tracing his IP address because he anonymized all his Internet activity using a program called Tor, for which he’d proudly submitted several patches.

He walked down a poorly lit hallway with dingy blue carpet before arriving in front of glass doors, upon which were etched the words “Patel and Associates,” and through which he recognized what appeared to be a reception area. Lock took a deep breath and pushed open the door. 

In stark contrast to the hallway outside, the office itself was surprisingly well-appointed, featuring burnished wood floors, a perky ficus tree that nearly reached the twelve-foot ceiling, and a thick Persian-style carpet that made Lock want to take his shoes and socks off. The air smelled vaguely of…incense? Whoever these people were, they weren’t recruiters.

He introduced himself to a caramel-skinned receptionist with a mole on her cheek and silky black hair that was pulled back tightly into a bun. She forced her mouth into a semblance of a smile and told him to have a seat. Lock guessed that he’d interrupted a riveting Facebook session.

He settled his lanky frame into a comfortable brown suede couch and picked up a copy of that morning’s *Wall Street Journal*. He took in the headlines with morose-orbed blue eyes and attempted to run his fingers through what would have been stringy blond hair, before remembering that he’d shaved his head. Kafka had convinced him it would look sexy. He ought to have known it was a prank. It was Kafka's way of encouraging him to get over his breakup with Mandy. As he pretended to read an article (“Buggy Trading Systems Put Markets At Risk,” warned the headline), he wondered if he ought to have worn something besides a sweatshirt and jeans. At least they were freshly laundered. And he’d worn his new bright-blue Converse hi-tops.

Lock caught himself tapping his foot. There really was only one reason why anyone would be interested in an ex-con with a penchant for quantum cryptography. *Especially* in the wake of the announcement of the Wave Nine. Well, if the Feds were going to pin something on him, he might as well deal with it. Maybe he could be like DJB or Aaron Swartz and take the government head on—

“Mr. Cairnes, Mr. Patel will see you now,” chimed the secretary.

Lock looked up from his paper with an affected arching of his eyebrows. He folded the paper back up, set it down, and stood, discretely wiping his palms on his jeans. He walked to the office door, which was closed, and looked over to the secretary—was he supposed to simply open the door, or knock? She nodded wordlessly. Lock opened the door and walked in.

“Ah, Mr. Cairnes,” said a man in a shiny gray silk suit, standing up behind a large desk made of a dark, heavy-looking wood. The muscles of his round face were relaxed. He blinked slowly and smiled with a faint air of condescension, as though he were amused by a child playing. He gestured toward an even larger black leather couch across the room. “Please, make yourself comfortable.”

Lock took in his surroundings, which were entirely consistent with the lobby, and included the addition of two wall-sized pieces of art and a spectacular view of Detroit’s west side and the snow-muted expanse of its frozen river. If he had an office like this, maybe Sophie would look up to him more, like she did Dennis, her stepfather. This office was even nicer than the one Dennis had in Bloomfield Hills.

“You can call me Lock,” he offered, easing himself into the couch. "What is it you guys do again?"

“We’ll get to that, I’m sure,” replied Kirin, strolling over to the couch. His heels clicked on the wood floor until he reached the border of a thick intricately patterned carpet. Lock noticed that his shoes were immaculately polished. He looked down at his new blue Converse, which suddenly seemed tacky. Kirin reached out and offered his hand. “Kirin Patel.”

Lock looked up and took his hand, shaking it awkwardly. Shaking hands was one of those strange customs, like wearing ties, that seemed to be from another time and place. He did his best, certain that his gawky handshake was unimpressive.

However, Kirin seemed unconcerned as he sat down in an expansive chair, his jacket parting to reveal a slight paunch, his hands placed casually, palms down, on the wide, flat armrests. Lock decided he needed a chair like that for his living room. His vibrating recliner suddenly struck him as…juvenile.

“Mr. Cairnes—Lock—I’d like to offer you a job,” began Kirin. He reached down to adjust his bright-blue pocket square, as though he'd suddenly noticed that it was out of place. As he looked up, Lock thought Kirin looked like a man who felt as if he’d gotten away with something. “It pays quite well,” continued Kirin, “and I think you’ll find the work very interesting.” He paused and leaned forward slightly. “How does that sound?”

“A job?” Lock heard himself echo dully. He looked out the far window at the cold blue sky, darkened by the window’s tint, and rubbed his hands together slowly. Perhaps this really was just a job interview. However, Kirin had skipped past the usual pointless questions and gone right to offering him the job. And there was still the question of how they'd known about his interest in quantum cryptography. “Sounds good, I guess,” Lock mumbled.

Kirin leaned back, looking surprised. “Don’t you want to know what kind of job it is?”

“Sure,” said Lock, his eyes wandering to the paintings on the wall. The one on the left was white with what looked to him like a brightly colored whirlpool viewed from above—various shades of reds and blues, with a smattering of yellows. Lock decided he liked it and wondered how much it had cost.

“I’d like you to build me a quantum computer,” said Kirin, an expectant smile on his face.

Lock laughed, partly because of the sheer absurdity of the statement and partly out of nervousness. What the hell was this guy up to? “A quantum computer?” he parroted, his eyes coming back to Kirin’s, his eyebrows raised.

“Yes,” said Kirin, looking mildly offended. Lock realized he must have sounded dismissive. Kirin elaborated. “What if I told you that we had licensed the technology from Coherence Technologies?”

Lock stopped laughing. Kirin didn’t look or act like he knew Shor’s algorithm from a brute-force dictionary attack. And no one actually called them Coherence Technologies. They were CoTech, or maybe Coherence. “For the Wave Nine? The NSA locked that up." Hadn't they? One rumor on the message boards was that the Wave Nine would be released once the Internet’s cryptography infrastructure had been upgraded to use algorithms that weren't vulnerable to quantum computing-based attacks. Another rumor held that the NSA already *had* a quantum computer, and simply didn't want anyone infringing on their monopoly.

Kirin ignored his objection. “What I’d like to do is hire you to build a quantum computer based on the specifications from Coherence Technologies.”

Lock’s eyes narrowed. “I can think of several folks in Ann Arbor alone who are probably better qualified than I am for something like that.”

Kirin waved his hand. “Nonsense, Lock. We need someone with, shall we say, practical hands-on experience, as much as we someone who understands the physics. Just like the Chief Scientist at Coherence Technologies. There really aren’t that many people like him. Or like you. At least not who would be interested in this job, mind you. The private sector isn’t for everyone. And, again, we’re happy to pay you a generous salary.”

Lock sat back and took a deep breath, his eyes wandering again to the view of the river outside. Maybe this was for real. Maybe he was so accustomed to failure at this point he couldn’t even trust an opportunity when it was handed to him. He took another breath and tried to focus on the pieces that didn’t yet fit. “You seem to know an awful lot about me.”

“Of course!” Kirin clapped his hands together as if something had been agreed on, showing his teeth with a Cheshire-cat smile.

Lock stared down at the glass-topped coffee table, which had one of those interactive magnet sculptures, presently featuring the outline of someone’s hand. Lock guessed it was the receptionist’s. He pursed his lips. The heel of his foot began moving up and down, seemingly of its own accord. He stopped breathing. “I get it,” he intoned, looking up slowly. “You haven’t actually licensed their technology.”

Kirin’s smiled slipped away for a moment, but then he began to laugh and rub his hands together. “Yes, you’re very clever. Not surprising, I suppose. That’s rather the point, isn’t it? Anyway, right. We *haven’t* actually licensed the technology. So we also need you to…ah, how shall I put this?”

“You need me to steal it,” interrupted Lock, his eyes closed.

“Yes, that’s it,” said Kirin, emphasizing the point with a ringed finger.

Lock slapped his hands on his thighs, preparing to get up. “Well, I’m sorry, Mr. Kirin—”

“Kirin, just Kirin is fine. My last name is—”

“—but I’m afraid I can’t help you.”

“We haven’t even talked about the money—”

“It’s not the money. I just can’t help you.” Lock stood up.

Kirin quickly rose too, moving a step toward Lock. “Don’t you *want* to build a quantum computer? Wouldn’t you find that *exciting*?”

Lock raised his hands as if to defend himself from Kirin’s advance. “Sure. It’d be interesting. But…well, I’m going to go.” He began walking toward the door.

“How about a salary of a…a million dollars annually?” asked Kirin.

Lock was halfway across the room. He turned. Even Kirin seemed surprised by the offer. He was apparently desperate--although Lock now understood why. He was being offered everything he’d wanted—but he couldn’t take it. He couldn’t risk going back to jail again. He couldn’t risk losing whatever was left of Sophie’s childhood. And, hell, it was probably a sting by the FBI or something anyway. “The answer is no. Got it?” He turned back toward the door and walked out of the room.

Donning his jacket in the elevator, he exhaled, his weight lifting slightly off his feet as he descended. He glared up at the descending floor numbers displayed above the door. “God dammit,” he cursed, slapping the burnished aluminum elevator wall, and wondering why he’d bothered coming at all.

#### Sentosa Cove, Singapore &bull; The Li Home

#### Thursday, January 18th

#### 9:00 a.m. SGT (Singapore Time)

Vipul Rathod felt a bit giddy as he shifted the black Acura SUV into park. Traveling without his usual entourage was liberating. And especially so since he’d just pulled into the ample driveway of one of his family’s chief rivals. If there was ever a place he was supposed to have his bodyguard, this was it.

He got out and walked along a curving sidewalk toward Li Mun’s sprawling estate. The morning sun seemed to make everything shinier, and there was a nice breeze blowing in off the ocean. It seemed like an awfully nice day to be contemplating murder.

He reached the porch and noticed a child’s scooter lying on its side. Did the old fattie have grandchildren? He pressed a button next to the large double doors and heard chimes playing a pleasant, familiar-sounding tune. He stepped back and waited, crossing his arms and looking askance at the neighboring lot. It was just as impressive as Li Mun’s. *Perhaps I should get one of these places for myself*, he thought.

The door opened just wide enough for a tall, severe-looking man to glare at him. “You’re Vipul Rathod?” he said with a heavy Chinese accent. Fresh off the boat.

“Yes,” replied Vipul.

The door opened a little wider. Vipul stepped into a large tiled foyer. “Raise your arms,” said the first man. He raised them and felt two sets of hands patting him down. They found nothing, just as he knew they wouldn’t, because he carried no weapons. He didn’t need them.

“Right this way,” said the stockier man, leading him into a large living room that was almost completely white, with white marble floors and patches of white rugs, as well as a white suede couch that formed a cushioned perimeter around the room. Light streamed in from two large sliding doors, offering a view of the ocean, which glimmered like a vast display-case of diamonds. He made his way into the room slowly, taking in the various details. A telescope. A large painting of a black circle on a—what else?—white canvas. A glass table with obsidian carvings of…something.

“Please make yourself comfortable,” said a woman’s voice behind him. Vipul turned. The stocky man was gone. The woman before him was so beautiful his knees nearly buckled. Waves of black hair cascaded down to her elegant neck. She had high cheekbones, almond-shaped eyes with golden irises, and lips that made him think of fresh raspberries. “My father will be with you shortly,” she said, and Vipul became light-headed. She was still talking. “Can I offer you a drink? Some coffee? Orange juice? Or mineral water, perhaps?”

“No,” Vipul managed to croak, his tongue sticking momentarily to the roof of his mouth. “Thank you.” He tried to smile, but realized that it hadn’t quite come off. It never did. He wasn’t much for smiling. Or women, for that matter. But this one…he wondered if she thought he was too small, too boyish looking. Or maybe she went for that. Women often told him he was—

“Very well, then. Like I said, my father will be in momentarily.” She turned and walked down a hall that led out of the vast living room. Vipul’s head tilted as he watched her hips sway with each step. She disappeared around a corner, and Vipul was two steps into the hallway himself before realizing he’d started following her. *That* was Li Mun’s daughter? *To hell with my brother*, he thought. *I should be proposing a dynastic marriage.* Maybe his brother had the same idea. Maybe that’s why he’d never mentioned the daughter. There was already enough bad blood between them as it was, without throwing Helen of Troy into the mix.

The thought of his real reason for coming focused him. He turned back toward the living room and sat down in a corner section of the expansive couch, then leaned back and mentally rehearsed the imminent encounter. A few moments later, he heard a shuffling sound. He turned and saw the old man entering the room; he was impressively rotund, with dark pockets of flesh beneath heavily lidded eyes, and sported a disastrous comb-over. *Hard to believe*, thought Vipul, *he’s one of the most powerful men in Singapore*.

Vipul stood up. Li Mun waved his hand as though to say Vipul needn’t have bothered. He shuffled over to a large lounge chair directly opposite Vipul and fell slowly backward into it. He stared at Vipul, raising his eyebrows and frowning slightly. Vipul said nothing.

They stared at each other.

“What the fuck are you doing here?” asked Li Mun finally.

Vipul attempted a smile again, but this time the icy overtones were intentional. “Nice to see you too, Li Mun.”

Li Mun glared, motionless.

Vipul found himself looking down at his brown loafers. He wasn’t accustomed to being stared down. Usually, he was the one doing the staring. He forced his eyes up to meet Li Mun’s gaze. “I’ll get to the point,” he said, his voice sounding too wispy. *This is it,* he told himself. *Get it together.* “We have a dispute, correct?” He paused, but Li Mun simply kept staring at him. “But I think we can both agree that my brother is a stubborn man.” His tone was sounding better now, a bit lower. “We can probably also agree that stubbornness is not a trait of a good leader.” *Ah, that’s too low. Don’t want to sound like you’re trying too hard.* “Resolving disputes like ours requires a willingness to come—”

“I’m not going to kill your fucking brother for you.”

Vipul could feel his heartbeat accelerate. Li Mun had skipped ahead of the script. How would his father have responded? Of course, that was an absurd question. His father was dead. And even if he'd been alive, old Bikram would have surely grabbed Vipul by the earlobe and--*focus*. “Ah,” was all he managed to say.

“Anything else?”

If nothing else, the old man had taught him not to give up. And Oxford and Harvard had taught him persuasiveness. In theory, anyway. “I understand. You’re concerned about the cost.”

“The cost? It’s the heat. Are you a child? In this town? I gotta lay up for months for something like that.”

“Which…costs you…money,” prompted Vipul, trying to conceal his impatience.

“Exactly,” said Li Mun.

Vipul watched the old man. He had barely moved since he’d sat down. Even his lips barely moved. He reminded Vipul of his old Zen master, Yuan. Except that Yuan wasn’t vain enough to bother with a comb-over and wasn’t obese. “But…if *I* were running things, you and I…I think we’d get along much better.”

“You’ll concede the points if I kill your brother. No. It’s not worth it.”

Vipul suddenly realized Li was bargaining with him. For a moment, he wanted to play just to see if he could win against such a formidable opponent. But then he remembered why he was really here. The points meant nothing to him. Let the cranky old bastard think he’d outwitted Bikram’s overeducated younger son. That actually made things easier. Vipul knew that the dispute between his brother and Li Mun was a complicated affair that came down to how they divvied up the profits from selling whores, mostly from India and China. Li Mun wanted a larger share of the Rathod organization’s profits because he provided most of the political protection. “Three points, then.”

Li Mun blinked slowly and shook his head.

*For God’s sake, man,* Vipul wanted to yell. He took a deep breath. *It’s just a game. And none of this matters anyway.* “Four,” replied Vipul. *I have to at least make it look like I’m trying.*

“Five.”

“Four is plenty. With all due respect.”

“With all due respect, go fuck yourself. We both know you’re a dead man without me. You’re lucky I don’t ask for points on your whole fucking business.”

Vipul sat back. A crooked smile played across his face. Li Mun probably understood his situation better than he did. He was a master. *When this is all over,* he thought, *I’m going to marry your daughter and then study everything you do.* “What’s your daughter’s name?” he asked, surprising himself.

“What? What do you care?”

“She’s very beautiful.”

“Yeah.”

“Five?”

“Give me five on the rest, and I’ll throw in my daughter.”

Vipul tried to laugh. He wasn’t good at it. He always risked sounding like a bleating sheep. He’d need to work on that. The important thing was that Li’s joke meant they had a deal. It was an awful deal by any ordinary standards. He’d have a hard time selling it to Anand. But they had a deal, nonetheless. Now he just needed to—

“How do you know your brother wasn’t here first?”

Vipul had begun standing up and so was caught half-sitting and half-standing. He hesitated for a moment and decided to stand. Further discussion just created unnecessary risk that the deal might go sideways. “I don’t,” he replied crisply and began walking toward Li Mun to shake on their deal.

Of course, if Satish *had* already proposed a deal, either Vipul had just made a better one, or he’d be dead momentarily. He was suddenly glad he hadn’t played hardball—and certain that he was going to walk out of Li’s home alive. 

Because there was no way his stubborn brother would have agreed to five points.

#### Jurong East, Singapore • Katya's Apartment

#### Thursday, January 18th

#### 9:30 a.m. SGT (Singapore Time)

Katya Brittain absentmindedly stirred her coffee with a spoon, even though she hadn’t put any sugar or cream in it yet. Her compact figure was curled up in the corner of an undersized yet abundantly cushioned sofa that she had selected specifically so that she could curl up in it each morning. Her Medusean black hair was pulled tightly back into a pony-tail, specifically so that she could feel the air-conditioning caress her neck. She stared into the screen of her laptop with dark and curious eyes, while balancing the laptop itself expertly across one of her thighs. She held her World’s Greatest Daughter coffee mug with one hand and stirred nothing into the coffee with the other. The mug had been specifically chosen to remind her of home, since, by necessity, almost nothing else in her modest apartment could.

A grainy black-and-white video was playing on her laptop. She watched as a man approached the entrace to a large resort home. She set the coffee mug down on the end table next to her, which itself had been carefully selected specifically so that it would serve as an extension to the sofa and allow her to set her coffee mugs on it without needing to pay too much attention to what she was doing. Several mugs' worth of coffee had been spilled over the years because of tables that were either too high or too low, and Katya had been determined to bring an end to that particular tragedy.

She dragged her finger across the trackpad, effectively rewinding the video, and then hit the spacebar on the keyboard to allow her to advance, frame by frame. Once in a while, she would stop and fire off an exotic sequence of keystrokes and mouse gestures that resulted in sending the captured frames to her printer, which was on the other side of the room next to a dying fern, a plant she’d selected specifically because it wasn’t supposed to die.

She hopped up from the easy chair and slid across the floor in her stockinged feet, skidding in front of the printer in a practiced move. She picked up the photos and studied them for a moment. She found their subject to be boyishly handsome. *Maybe he’s dating the daughter,* she conjectured. She walked over to a bare desk in front of a window, a plastic-and-metal affair that hadn’t been selected specifically for any reason at all because Katya rarely used it, except to set things on it, which is what she did with the photos. She stared out the window, which gave her a view of the rooftops of a number of other apartment buildings and then, peeking out from behind them some distance away, the lush green of the parks surrounding Jurong Lake. Beyond *that*, she mused, where the wharfs and the Singapore Straight, and then, of course, Malaysia and the Indian Ocean. She looked back at the grainy photo that lay on top of the others, at a young man squinting in the sunlight, his shoulders slightly hunched. He looked vaguely haunted. Probably just another cad chasing after Li Mun's daughter. Still, she'd ask Ong Goh about him, just in case.

#### Corktown, Detroit • Mad Dog's Tavern

#### Thursday, January 18th

#### 11:00 p.m. EST (Eastern Standard Time)

“A million dollars?” asked Kafka incredulously, shocks of black hair emerging at unexpected angles from the top of his oblong head.

“I could have probably gotten two,” replied Lock, finishing a sip of beer. He looked across the bar at the old photo of “Mad Dog” Sullivan, an angry-looking Irish gangster who was the bar’s namesake. Lock loved the antique feel of the place—the bar had originally been a speakeasy back when Detroit was the principal port of entry for liquor coming in from Canada. With the red brick walls and the gaslights glowing in their frosted sconces, it was as though the bar was part of some hidden, timeless alley.

“*Two* million? Are you kidding me?” Kafka stared straight at Lock through his thick-framed glasses. They’d fallen out of fashion a few years earlier, but Kafka hadn’t cared. He’d been wearing the same glasses since before they were in fashion to begin with.

Lock gave him a sidelong glance and couldn’t suppress a wry smile. “Yeah, he threw out a million when he realized I was walking out. Hell, maybe I could get him up to three. Or five.”

“Lock, you guys need another round?” asked Vicky from farther down the bar, a towel thrown over her shoulder. She wore her dark-brown hair back, and Lock admired the creative ways she found to accentuate an already prominent bosom. Tonight her strategy involved a black T-shirt, torn open at the neckline to form a ragged V-neck, with the words “Ask me if I care” emblazoned across the front in white gothic script.

“Sure, Vicky, but when are they going to get some real Irish girls in here?” asked Lock.

Vicky gave him an exaggerated frown but said nothing, grabbing two glasses from beneath the bar and filling them from a tap.

“So are you going to take it?” asked Kafka. 

Lock leaned sideways and sneered. “Really? You have to ask me that?”

Kafka shrugged, as if protesting his innocence. “I don’t know, man. You just get in and get out. Also, fuck man…building a quantum computer? You’d do that for free.”

Lock shook his head vigorously. “I just can’t risk it.”

“I get that, when we were talking a few Ben Franklin’s to change someone’s grades. But…this is the real deal, man. This is…how’d they get your name, anyway?”

“Here are you are, gentlemen,” offered Vicky, setting the two full pint glasses in front of them.

“Vicky, does my friend Lock here look like a criminal to you?” asked Kafka.

“Nah. He just looks tragic.”

“Tragic?” asked Lock, straightening his posture. “I look *tragic*?”

“Yeah, you got those tragic eyes.” Vicky gave him a sly smile before wheeling and heading back down to the other end of the bar. 

Lock shook his head slightly and took a swig from his beer, marveling at the myriad tip-maximizing tactics that Vicky had mastered.

“So how’d they get your name?” Kafka pressed.

“Don’t know. That’s a good question.”

“Message boards, maybe?”

“Maybe. The thing is...”

“Yeah?”

“You’re right. I *would* do it for free. Imagine having your own quantum computer. That’d be something. I’d love to try Grover’s algorithm on something besides a simulator. You know, for *real*. Actually see what kind of crazy things I can do with it.”

“What’s the big deal with quantum computers again? I mean, I know that they have qubits instead of bits, but I always sort of forget the details…”

Lock gazed at the back of the bar as though a movie were projected on it. “Well, the easiest way to get it, is to think about simulating quantum mechanical interactions. We can model them with wave functions, but, on a transistor-based computer, running those models is relatively slow because we’re translating wave functions into a bunch of logic operations.”

“Ones and zeroes…”

“Right. On a quantum computer, however, we aren’t using transistors, we’re using the state of a quantum particle directly. For example, the spin--"

“Is that Black Irish playing? I think that’s Black Irish.”

"--of an electron or the polarity of a photon. Yes, that's Black Irish."

"I thought so." Kafka returned his attention to Lock, with mock seriousness. "Continue, please, professor."

"You asked the damn question. Anyway, naturally, our simulation runs much faster, because, in a sense, it’s not really a simulation anymore. We’re actually changing the state of quantum particles.”

“Like if we wanted to model the effect of weed on the brain, the best way to do it would be to actually smoke some weed.”

Lock smiled in spite of himself and sipped from his pint glass. “Sure. I guess. The thing is, lots of things are based on wave functions, not just quantum particles. To use your analogy of the brain, we know humans are really good at pattern recognition. Like I can recognize you or Vicky. I’d probably recognize you even if you grew a mustache and put on a hat.”

“Or if you were really stoned.”

“Also, yes. But…where was I? Oh, yeah. Pattern recognition is useful for other things, too, like diagnoising medical conditions. So it’d be real useful if we could hook up transistor-based computers to brain-based computers to do pattern recognition. But we can’t because we don’t know how to build brains.”

“Which is too damn bad.”

“But we do know how to build quantum computers. Thanks to CoTech. It was hard problem because quantum particles are really small, obviously, and really unstable.”

“This is all coming back to me now. Each qubit can have more information than a bit on transistor-based computers. Because it’s a wave form? So lots of qubits allows for really complex wave forms.”

“Exactly. It’s like an MP3 file. It’s just a big, complex wave form. But there’s enough information there for us to hear Black Irish.”

“And then you can use a different set of algorithms, like Fourier transforms.”

“Right, because they operate directly on wave functions. Those algorithms run blindingly fast on a quantum computer because the computer’s state already *is* a wave form, not a bunch of switches that are pretending to be a wave form.”

“Ah, that’s right. And we know how to use Fourier transforms to do things like integer factorization, which normally take exponential time—“

“Well, not exponential, but…almost, yeah.”

Kafka frowned disapprovingly. “As I was saying. Finding prime factors takes a long time on transistor-based computers. But on a quantum computer, since we can use Fourier transforms, we can use a different algorithm, and it runs much faster.”

“In polynomial time. For really large numbers this is a big difference. Seconds, instead of years. Most of the cool things you can do with quantum computers are based on that idea: algorithms that use wave functions, which we have to *simulate* with bits and bytes, run much faster on qubits, because qubits *are* wave forms already.”

“I remember you running those simulations. What was that language?”
v
“QCL. Yeah. I was always trying to show you some cool new algorithm.”

“Yeah,” said Kafka. “But I just wanted to play Super Mario.”

Lock laughed and looked down into his beer. “Yeah, and that fucking game where you had to rescue Zelda and never did.”

Kafka chuckled. “Yeah. That game was awesome. Dodongo dislikes smoke!”

Lock shook his head. “We thought we had it all figured it out.”

“Hey, we had a good time.”

“Easy for you to say.”

“Right. Sorry. I just meant—”

Lock waved his hand without looking up. “Forget it. The thing is...”

“What?”

Lock took a long draught from his pint glass. “Stealing it. That’s a different story. And I’m not even sure I could build it, even if I had the plans. I mean, you need diamond crystals, finely calibrated magnetic fields—”

“But that’s the whole idea of stealing the specs. All that stuff would be in there.”

“Yeah. Maybe. But if there’s one detail left out...”

“So…you’re *thinking* about it?”

“No, man. I mean, *of course* I’m thinking about it. You know, like I think about maybe one day I’m gonna sleep with Vicky. But not *really*. I told you. Too risky.”

“Two million dollars is a lotta cheddar, though.”

“Hell, for all I know, it’s an FBI sting or something.”

“A sting? Wouldn’t that be entrapment?”

Lock looked up and found himself amused by Kafka’s earnestness. “You don’t think they’d just lie about it? I’d rather not be the martyr.”

Kafka lifted his glass. “I hear that.” 

Lock sank into the aural ambience of laughter and hushed voices and another indie band that he couldn't quite place playing on the jukebox. 

“Hey,” said Kafka. Lock felt a wiry hand on his shoulder. “Isn’t it your fucking birthday?”

Lock shrugged.

“So what are we doing to celebrate?” demanded Kafka.

“Not much,” answered Lock. “I’m opening tomorrow.”

“Aw. Why didn’t you ask for the time off?”

“Need the hours. Every time I do that, Rich cuts my damn hours.”

“Come on, man.” Kafka sat up and looked around the bar. “We need to at least get you laid.”

Lock frowned. “You make it sound like that only happens once a year.”

“Well, since Mandy dumped your ass...”

“I dumped *her*,” insisted Lock.

Kafka raised his hands in the air. “Okay, okay. I just remember you sitting on my couch—”

“Oh, like you’ve never had a weak moment.”

Vicky seemed to appear from nowhere. “Hey, what about Sophie?” she asked.

“What about her?” asked Lock.

“Are you guys doing anything?”

Lock puzzled over Vicky’s apparent ability to participate in a dozen conversations at once. Yet another tip-maximizing skill. “Yeah. I’m taking her and Krista snowboarding.”

“That’s so sweet.”

Lock nodded and took another sip from his beer. “If I'm lucky, she'll come over afterwards and we can rent a movie and order a pizza. She used to love that. But now…”

“She’s sixteen, Lock,” counseled Vicky. “That’s all. She’s just outgrown it.”

“She’s outgrown me.”

“Nah,” said Vicky. Lock looked up just as she winked at him and scampered away again.

“Two million dollars,” mused Kafka, cocking an eyebrow. “You could buy Sophie her own slope.”

Lock regarded his friend warily from the corner of his eyes. “You’re such an asshole.”

“Or maybe I just work for the FBI.”

#### Pioneer Wharf, Singapore

#### Saturday, January 20th

#### 4:30 a.m. SGT (Singapore Time)

Katya put down the field glasses and wiped her brow. Her black Lycra tights felt constricting in the night’s thick, damp heat. She leaned back against a large shipping container, concealed in its shadow. After counting ten deep breaths, she peered cautiously from around the corner, raising her field glasses to her eyes.

Li Mun was speaking to a dozen men in black suits who stood around him in a semicircle. Behind them were four black Mercedes SUVs. Katya found Li Mun’s presence here puzzling. The day before, she'd noticed a spike in the chatter from Li Mun’s lieutenants. They never said much, and what they did say was nearly impossible to make sense of, even after months of listening in. But in her years in the field, she’d learned to infer a great deal through context. How many calls had been made? How far apart were they? Did the speakers sound tense? She knew *something* was happening tonight, even if she didn’t know what.

She’d picked up Li Mun’s cavalcade after they had crossed the bridge leaving the Li Estate on Sentosa Island. The use of a private wharf like this one would normally have suggested to Katya they were smuggling in young women. But there was no reason for Li Mun to concern himself with such a routine event.

Two more black Mercedes SUVs pulled up, and more men in black suits began spilling out of them. There was a strange tension in their movements, but Katya couldn’t quite identify what it was. Abruptly, she recognized the man who got out of the rearmost vehicle: Satish Rathod. Now it all started to make sense. The Rathods were a relatively small-time crime family, not nearly as influential as the Li Triad, and certainly not Triad. But they were players, nonetheless. Probably here to negotiate some sordid business arrangement.

The two men shook hands, encircled by what amounted to a platoon’s worth of nervous soldiers. In their midst, the two principals chatted easily, like old friends. Katya hadn’t bothered setting up mikes or cameras—the place was too wide open. She was probably too close as it was.

She leaned back against the shipping container and took another deep breath. This was something of a letdown. She’d been hoping for a breakthrough—perhaps a meeting with the trade minister, or at least the deputy minister. She considered just packing up and leaving. But then she thought of Ong Goh. Another trick that nearly a decade in the field had taught her—information was currency. Maybe she’d learn something that would be useful to the SPF. After all, they needed a warrant to do surveillance here. Whatever was happening, she was the only way they’d ever know about it. And although the CIA was on friendly terms with the SPF, and she was on good terms with her contact, Ong Goh, it never hurt to come bearing gifts.

She squatted down to fish around in a black canvas bag she’d brought with her. She pulled out a small black camera and then slowly peered around the corner again. She heard the rumble of a boat and then saw its outline as it approached the dock. The running lights were off. She heard voices calling out—they were guiding the vessel in. Everyone was now facing the shore, which meant there wasn’t much point in taking pictures because there were no faces. Still, she held the camera in position. They’d turn around eventually. She’d snap a few pictures proving the meeting between Li Mun and Satish Rathod had taken place, and then she’d split.

It was girls after all. The catcalls started even before she could see them. Perhaps they were a gift to cement some business deal? The first of them appeared at the front of the barge, alighting unsteadily on the dock with the help of several of the gangsters. Then a second and a third. Satish and his men were acting as though they’d never seen women before. Li Mun’s crew had actually withdrawn slightly. Curiously, they weren’t looking at the girls—

Gunfire flashed and cracked and the women screamed and nine men were thrown backward, falling to the ground. Katya’s arms fell to her sides before she remembered the camera. She brought it back up, focused, and held the button down. She took a round of photos and put the camera down again, watching with naked eyes. Li Mun’s men advanced, divvying up the slain and carefully firing one round into each of their skulls.

Kill shots. Take no chances.

And leave no traces. Weapons dangled from shoulder straps or disappeared into holsters. Keys were taken from pockets. Bodies were picked up and thrown aboard the barge that had brought the girls, who in turn were loaded into the newly orphaned SUVs. The motor of the barge fired up, grumbled a bit, and the ship drifted back into the darkness. The SUVs efficiently formed a parade of tail lights leading back out to the main highway.

Within ten minutes of the first shots, the wharf was empty.

Katya slid down behind her container and realized she wasn’t breathing. *Calm down*, she told herself. It was just another gangland execution. Li Mun had, for some reason, decided he’d had enough of Satish Rathod. No big deal, not her concern. But still, her hands were shaking. Even though she had some military training, spook fieldwork was mostly surveillance and relationships. She’d never witnessed anything this violent firsthand.

She looked at the camera and began flipping through the photos she’d taken, partly out of curiosity and partly just to calm herself. Neither Li Mun nor Satish Rathod’s faces were identifiable in a single photo. Satish, of course, had been on the ground by the time she’d starting taking pictures. Li Mun had quietly lumbered into the back of one of the SUVs, never once turning toward the camera. She wondered if perhaps he’d known she was there. She looked around nervously, but there was nothing but looming shipping containers and shadows upon shadows. She placed the camera back in the bag, hoisted it over her shoulder, and hurriedly disappeared into the darkness.

#### Tally Bar, Singapore

#### Saturday, January 20th

#### 10:30 p.m. SGT (Singapore Time)

Katya worked her way through the crowd at the legendary Tally Bar and climbed up the spiral staircase to find Ong Goh at his usual table in the far corner. She sat down across from him and smiled. He always managed to look at her like she was the only woman on earth. She admired the Clark Gable mustache and the confident look in his eye and the impeccable way he dressed, with a cravat and neatly turned-out collar, his silver hair always slicked back—and his whiskey glass never empty. Ong Goh was truly a man from a bygone era.

“Hello, my darling,” he growled, his voice somehow cutting through the sound of the drum solo from *Sing, Sing, Sing*. “Will you marry me?”

“You’re already married.” Ordinarily, Katya would have merely tolerated the harassment, taking the high road in the name of some larger goal. She believed she had pretty thick skin. But coming from Ong Goh, it was somehow, if not charming, at least inoffensive.

“I’ll get divorced.”

“Ask me again when it comes through.”

“I will.”

A waiter appeared. Ong Goh ordered for her: “Whiskey sour for my beautiful companion.”

“Just a soda water with lime,” corrected Katya.

Ong Goh frowned. “How can I take advantage of you if you’re always sober.”

Katya smiled patronizingly. “I have some interesting news.”

“There are no words you can speak that would not be interesting, my darling Katya.”

“Right. Last night—well, I guess it was early this morning—Li Mun’s thugs shot and killed Satish Rathod and…eight of his men.”

“Not seven or nine?”

“No. Eight.”

“My, my. Where?”

“There’s a private wharf they use, west of the airport. They use it mostly for girls. But this time there was some kind of meet. Apparently, it didn’t go well.”

“Satish dead. And the little brother isn’t even in the business.”

“The little brother?”

“Vipul. Their father sent him off to Oxford. Sort of the runt of the family.”

“Hmm. So he’s like Michael Corleone.”

“A *Godfather* reference? Sure. Except his father’s already dead.”

“That brings me to another question.” Katya delved into her purse and pulled out the photos she’d printed from the video capture outside Li Mun’s home. “Is this Vipul, perhaps?”

Ong Goh put down his whiskey and examined the photos. Katya’s soda water arrived, and she took a sip. “Could be,” said Ong Goh. “I’d have to run it by someone to be sure. Can I keep these?”

“Sure. I have some others from the wharf last night, but they don’t show much except a bunch of guys in suits lying on the ground.”

“I can see that in the alley beside the hotel any night of the week.”

Katya smiled.

Ong Goh leaned back and took a long draught of whiskey. He stared at Katya. “In all seriousness, why won’t you run away with me?”

“What do you make of all this? Why is—what’s the brother's name again?”

“Vipul. Don’t you know, I’m very unhappily married.”

“No, you’re not. Do you think Vipul made some kind of deal with Li Mun? Was it a power play? Did he arrange to have his brother killed?”

Ong Goh leaned forward and took Katya’s hand. “You mustn’t overthink these things, my love. The criminal mind is rarely complicated. Anyway, who cares? The Triad is our real concern.”

Katya withdrew her hand. “I know. I just thought it might be useful intel.”

“I’ll pass it on. Thank you. Do you have anything else?”

“Not this time. You?”

“Not much. As expected, our minister is planning to support the quota proposal.”

“That’s good.”

“That’s terrible.”

“Except that I have his cell conversations with Li Mun. So it proves Li Mun is influencing him.”

“It proves nothing. We have nothing to go after him with and nothing to show Triad influence. You know I can’t use your surveillance.”

“Not directly, no. You know better than I, this is how it always starts. A piece here and a piece there.”

“If it means dragging this case out so I can spend my evenings with you, I’m all for it.”

Katya smiled wearily. “Not quite what I meant.”

#### Chinese Garden, Singapore

#### Sunday, January 21st

#### 5:30 a.m. SGT (Singapore Time)

Had anyone been surveilling Katya, they would have known that every morning she went for a long walk, all the way down to the Chinese Garden and then back. And every morning she’d meet with what they might guess was a retired gentleman who had a fondness for Panama hats, guayabera shirts, and perhaps attractive young women of ambiguous ethnicity. They would meet a little after sunrise on weekdays—perhaps thirty-minutes later on weekends—on a bridge near the twin pagodas overlooking Jurong Lake and have a chat. They were creatures of habit, it seemed, as they rarely missed a day. Perhaps they’d become friends, in time, meeting each morning like that. Maybe it was just knowing that the other was going to be there, looking forward to saying hello and hearing the latest news.

Or maybe…

<div style="margin-left: 40%">&#968;</div>

This particular morning, as on most mornings, Haruo Quartan arrived before Katya. He leaned over the railing, appearing to stare out at the calm surface of the lake.

Katya walked to the apex of the bridge, taking her place next to him, and assuming the same posture. “Good morning, Haruo,” she said.

“Good morning, Katya. I hear Mr. Li has been a bad boy.”

“I saw it myself.”

Haruo paused. “What tipped you off?”

“Chatter.”

“Cell phones?”

“Yes.”

“They never learn.”

Katya smiled to herself. “I’d like to think perhaps it has something to do with listening patiently for nearly two years. Not to mention Hong Kong.”

“There’s that,” acknowledged Haruo.

Katya smiled again. “Thank you.”

“What’s he about?”

“Li Mun? I think it’s actually a coup happening in another family. Li Mun was just the trigger man.”

“Which family?”

Katya straightened up, leaving just a hand on the railing, and turned toward Haruo, who was still looking out over the lake. “Fairly small-time. The Rathods?”

Haruo made a slight humming sound.

Katya wondered if that meant he’d heard of them. “The younger brother, Vipul, got rid of the older one, Satish,” she added helpfully.

“For Li Mun to intervene...”

Katya was eager to show Haruo that she had explored all the implications. “Vipul must have conceded something.”

“A great deal, I would imagine. This is Singapore, after all.”

Katya was silent. Haruo apparently wasn’t impressed by her analysis. *This is Singapore.* Murder was rare in the island city-state. Of course, that was partly because it was so easy to get rid of the bodies. The murder of Satish and his men would very likely never show up in the official statistics.

“The younger brother is up to something. Li must realize it too.”

Katya took a different angle. Haruo was always telling her to stay focused. She wanted to make sure he knew that she had. “Given our mission here...”

“You’re probably right.”

They were silent for a few moments. Sometimes, there just weren’t any new developments worth talking about. Katya prepared to say good-bye.

But apparently it was okay for Haruo to get distracted. “What do we know about the younger brother?”

“Not much. Ong Goh is going to send me the SPF profile. Western education. Oxford. Was not directly involved in the family business.”

“You see the problem?”

Katya did not. What had she missed? She waited for Haruo to continue.

“In medieval Europe, the nobility sent the younger sons into the clergy. Today, gangsters send their younger sons to Oxford and Harvard.”

Katya desperately wanted to see the connection.

Haruo’s mind continued down whatever rabbit hole it had fallen into. “The father, then, he’s passed on?”

“Yes,” confirmed Katya, recalling Ong Goh's observation from the night before, and wondering what had inspired Haruo's guess.

Haruo made a low humming sound. “Let's set up on Vipul.”

“I don’t understand.” Katya stared intently at Haruo as if she might be able to see into his mind and learn the secrets of how it worked.

“There’s nothing to understand, Katya. That’s exactly the problem.”

She turned back toward the lake and stared at a family of turtles swimming past, feeling stupid.

“Katya. You’re looking for connections. Sometimes you have to look for disconnections.” Quartan paused. “I’m not talking about the whole works. Just the basics. A radio scanner. A few cameras. Just to have it. Just in case.”

“Okay.”

“Anything else?”

“Ong Goh proposed to me again.”

“I wish you both the best.”

Katya laughed in spite of her frustration. “I didn’t accept!”

“Ah. Well, you should. He’s a fine old cadger.”

“He’s married!”

“To a fine woman, in fact. Until tomorrow?”

“Good-bye, Haruo.”

“Good-bye, Katya.”

#### Little India, Singapore

#### Sunday, January 21st

#### 9:00 a.m. SGT (Singapore Time)

Vipul wiped a bead of sweat from his brow as he scanned the faces of the family’s lieutenants, seven of whom had recently been promoted. The chairs at the tables were all occupied, and there were still another dozen men standing. They were all packed into the back room of Desi, a restaurant whose real purpose was to launder money and give them a place to meet discretely. It was hot and dank, and the smell of sweat and curry made Vipul's eyes water.

Anand’s imposing figure loomed over his own, even though Vipul was standing as tall as he could. He never stopped being impressed by Anand’s stature. Everything about him was oversized: his bald head, his broad shoulders, his ring-clad, claw-like hands. His eyes always seemed to be narrowed and his jaw clenched. “Everybody’s here,” he whispered to Vipul.

Vipul had no way of knowing. The faces looked familiar, but that was all. His father had sometimes brought him along to meetings not much different than this one. "Watch and learn," he'd growl, "but say nothing." Sometimes he would go to the office of his brother, *om shanti*, to engage in another round of their interminable arguments…and someone would interrupt, waved in by his brother, striding into the office past him like he wasn't there, leaning forward to whisper something into his brother's ear. And then there were the family gatherings, where he'd see them lurking in the back, mere shadows consorting at the fringes of the laughter and conversation, occassionally exchanging whispers with each other or his father or his brother. So he had a uneasy familiarity with them, but that was all.

Thank goodness for Anand. Or, rather, for his father’s foresight in asking Anand to take Vipul under his wing. His father had known this day would come. And Anand had embraced the role, just as his father had known he would. Anand understood what his father was trying to do. But the rest of the organization saw Vipul as a threat.

Just like his brother had.

Vipul leaned over to Anand. “In the green shirt, there, that’s Paresh, right?” he whispered.

Anand looked down at him from the corner of his eyes. “Right.”

“And the one with the scar is Sameer?”

“Yes.”

Vipul straightened up. “Good to see you again, Paresh.”

Paresh nodded respectfully. They were going to at least give him a chance, apparently.

“And you, Sameer. How have you been?”

Sameer shrugged. Vipul could see immediately that he’d made a mistake. Sameer must have been close to one or more of the men who’d “disappeared” last night. Vipul didn’t want to appear too cheerful. After all, his brother had just died. *Om shanti.*

Vipul decided it was time to begin. “Quiet please,” he said in Hindi. No one seemed to notice.

“Quiet please!” yelled Anand. Instantly, the room went silent.

“Thank you,” said Vipul, continuing on in his normal speaking voice. “As you know, early this morning my brother and several of our family were to meet and negotiate terms with the Li Triad for the girls we provide to…establishments in Geylang and other areas. They did not return.” Vipul let his words hang in the air for a moment. He decided that his voice was wavering too much. He needed to sound more forceful. “We were able to confirm via other sources that, as we suspected, Li Mun executed them and dumped their bodies in the strait.” Vipul looked at the faces staring back at him impassively. He tried to meet their eyes, each in turn, just as he’d watched his father do. These were the kinds of nuances Satish had never grasped. “We must obviously retaliate.”

There was a sudden burst of oaths to avenge their fallen brothers. Vipul held up his hand. The room gradually fell quiet. Vipul was relieved he hadn’t had to rely on Anand again to silence the men.

“But we must be patient.” He could feel the air become still. “Now I know what you are all thinking. Believe me. What do I know about these things? What does Bikram’s sheltered son know about anything besides books and computers? I know you are thinking that if we do not retaliate, then where will this end? Little by little, your business will be eaten away. This is how my brother thought too, and I knew his mind better than you might think.”

Vipul paused again and looked down at the floor, as though considering carefully what he was going to say next. Of course, he knew exactly what he was going to say next. He looked up, right into Sameer’s eyes. “But wars are costly too.” He moved his gaze to Paresh. “Li Mun chose his moment carefully. There will be no bodies. There are no witnesses, at least none who will speak to the police. At most, there will be a few reports of gunshots and that’s all. There will be no heat. He will not be sending anyone home to China. But…if we choose to retaliate now…without picking the time and the the place…without being very careful…*we* will pay the price. Not Li Mun. But us.” Vipul paused again. They were considering what he was saying. They didn’t like it, but they were thinking about it. That’s all he needed. For now.

“That’s why I’m going to offer Li Mun a truce,” he continued. “I will give him the terms he seeks.” The grumbling began before the words were out of his mouth. Vipul held up his hand, and again it had the desired effect. “I will *allow* him to think that he has won. He will assume, as you do—” Vipul paused for effect, “—that I am nothing more than a schoolboy, too weak to oppose him. And he will assume that you—” Vipul waved his arm grandly at the men, “—are without a leader, that you will crumble, and fall apart, and then he will take you on, one at a time.” Vipul paused. He was likely straining their capacity for strategic thinking at this point. It was time to wrap it up—something he’d learned, not from his father, at least not directly, but at Harvard. Leadership was about defining a mission that everyone could identify with.

He brought his point home. “And when the time is right…when he is comfortable…we will do to him just as he has done to us. When he least suspects it, we will set an ambush. We will kill Li Mun—” Vipul raised his voice slightly, “—and we will destroy the Li Triad—” and then raised it a little more, “—and avenge my brother’s death…and those of all our fallen brothers!”

The room was silent. Vipul could hear a water heater fire up somewhere. There were plates clinking together in the kitchen in the next room. He surveyed his audience with his eyes. He had expected them to cheer at this point, but at least they were rapt with attention. Some jaws were slack, others firm, but no one was indifferent.

That would have to do. He turned to Anand, who was glaring at the men, his eyes slitted, the muscles in his stubbled jaw working. “Let’s go,” he said quietly, and he walked out of the room.

*I am your leader now*, he was saying to the family’s lieutenants. There would be no questions, no debate. Of course, he knew the moment he left the room they would curse him as a weakling and predict disaster for the family. But he also knew they would do nothing about it.

“What did you think?” he asked Anand after they were settled in the backseat of his SUV, heading back to the office.

“I think they will grow impatient quickly.”

“How quickly?”

Anand paused. “A month or two. At most.”

Vipul stared at the back of the seat in front of him and shook his head. “That’s not enough time. We’ve only just begun to recruit the engineer.”

Anand merely turned his enormous hands palms up.

“Speaking of which, have you heard anything?”

“Kirin made contact.”

“And?”

“No luck. Yet.”

#### Near West Side, Detroit • Kingfisher Used and Rare Books

#### Sunday, January 21st

#### 10:15 a.m. EST (Eastern Standard Time)

Lock had been lobbying Richard for years to get an espresso machine installed in the bookstore. Maybe clear a shelf or two and add a few nice chairs. His justification was that it would be nice for the customers, but mostly he wanted it so he could avoid the half-mile walk to the Bean Bar. He hugged himself as he stood in line, trying to get warm.

A few minutes later, Lock was comfortably ensconced in a pea-green easy chair that had been abandoned by its prior inhabitant just as Lock had taken a hot mug of cappuccino in his hands. He closed his eyes and began recounting in his mind a recent exposition on string theory he’d given for a customer. He’d been particularly pleased with it and was considering sharing it on a message board after work. He’d made an analogy between the strings of a guitar making musical notes and—

“Mr. Cairnes, if I may have a word.” The voice was familiar but Lock’s mind struggled to identify it.

He opened his eyes and saw finely woven black wool slacks, and as his gaze trailed upward, he recognized the face of Kirin Patel. He sat up.

“I must admit,” Kirin continued, “I am surprised not to have heard from you.” He smiled. “I thought you would reconsider.”

Lock said nothing.

Kirin grabbed an empty wooden chair from a nearby table and pulled it up in front of Lock’s seat. He sat down and leaned forward. “I can’t imagine the money isn’t of interest to you,” he said softly.

Lock cleared his throat and looked around to see if anyone was listening. “It’s not that...”

“Are you worried you’ll be caught?”

“No, not exactly.”

“I can assure you that we will provide you with the very best legal counsel if it comes to that. Not that it would. And we have places where you can—”

“I’m just not interested. And I think—”

“Think of your daughter. Think of her future.”

Lock stared down at his ratty black work shoes. At least in Kirin’s office, he’d had his nice new Converse on. Now he just looked…broke.

“Her *security*,” continued Kirin. Lock looked up, and it felt like Kirin was leaning even further forward than he had been. And had his eyes had narrowed?

“Her security?”

“Absolutely.” Kirin shifted backward almost imperceptibly and smiled again.

They sat in silence for a moment. Lock watched an attractive blond in a black leather coat put sugar into a steaming cup. A barista called out for someone named Kenneth.

Kirin stood up. Lock turned and looked up at him. “Young man,” he began in the tone of a father lecturing his wayward son, “are you going to spend the rest of your life shelving books? You have considerable talent. Perhaps you should consider doing something useful with it.” Kirin paused and half turned toward the door. “Or I suppose you could spend the rest of your life paying for the indiscretions of your youth.”

Lock watched him turn and walk out the door into the cold. Kirin hadn't been wearing a coat. Lock replayed the conversation in his mind. *Think of your daughter. Think of her future. Her security.* What did that mean, exactly? Was it a threat…or just friendly advice?

Lock took another sip of his cappuccino and then decided to get back to work. He grabbed a to-go cup and poured his cappuccino into it, then followed the blond in the black leather coat out the door. The icy cold wind hit him like a punch in the nose, making his eyes water suddenly. He winced and took another sip of his cappuccino, desperate for warmth. What kind of person didn't wear a coat in weather like this?

Lock watched the woman walk to her car. It was a later-model Lincoln, brown and stained with salt along the bottom. A dreary looking car, but substantial nonetheless. The woman disappeared behind the tinted windows. Lock imagined that the salesman she’d bought it from had called the color taupe.

*Must be nice*, he thought as he trudged along West Congress, careful to avoid the ice patches. With two million bucks, he thought, he could have a car like that, too.

#### Lafayette Park, Detroit • Lock's Apartment

#### Sunday, January 21st

#### 7:00 p.m. EST (Eastern Standard Time)

“Oh! I forgot!” exclaimed Sophie, her mouth stuffed with cheese pizza.

“You forgot what?” inquired Lock as he scrolled through the movie options displayed on his thirty-five-inch flat-screen. They sat on his dilapidated blue couch, plates on their laps, with a half pizza on the floor in front of them. A wintery darkness had made itself at home in his apartment, with only the eerie glow of the television serving as a post-modern fireplace.

“Guess!” demanded Sophie.

“You forgot to go to school. What about *Iron Man*? You want to watch that?”

“No, I hate that movie.”

“You hate it? You love that movie.”

“I *used* to. Guess.”

“I did guess. You forgot to go to school.”

“No, but that’s a good idea.”

“It’s a terrible idea.”

“Guess again?”

“You forgot to leave a trail of breadcrumbs so you can find your way home.”

“No. Besides, I’m going to school in the morning, not home.”

“Unless you forget?”

“Can I?”

“No. What about *Blade Runner*?”

“Wow. How many times can you watch that movie? Guess.”

“You forgot your real identity, and now you just think you’re a little girl growing up in Detroit who really wants to watch *Blade Runner* again.”

“I’m not a little girl anymore, Dad. And I don’t want to watch *Blade Runner* again. So…no. You want me to tell you?”

“Yes, I give up.”

“I’m going to Hawaii!”

Lock turned and looked at her. She was staring at the television for some reason, even though there was nothing on it besides the movie listings. Maybe his ex-wife was a faithless Jezebel, but he couldn’t deny they made pretty babies. Sophie’s sandy hair tumbled in natural ringlets to her shoulders. That was from Karen. But those blue eyes that flashed with purpose and awareness—those were from him. Her cheeks were rosy and accented her pale Irish complexion. She got that from him, too. She shoved what remained of the slice of pizza she was eating into her mouth and reached for her glass of root beer. Lock was almost certain the root beer was going to end up all over the carpet or the couch, but for the moment anyway, the crisis was averted. “Hawaii?”

“Yeah! Over spring break! Dennis is taking us!”

“Oh.” Lock felt as though a small hole were opening up inside of him. They’d always talked about going to Hawaii together. He forced a smile. “For how long?”

“Two weeks!” She looked at him, smiling, sauce smeared on her chin.

“Two weeks?” repeated Lock, incredulous.

“Yeah!”

Lock frowned. “Wait. How long is spring break?”

“A week, I think.”

“So you’re going to be out of school for a week?”

“Well, no. Because there’s the weekend before and the weekend after, and plus we have the Friday before. So I’ll only miss two days!”

Lock grunted and eyed his glass of root beer.

<div style="margin-left: 40%">&#968;</div>

They ended up watching *Mean Girls* again. Sophie never spilled her root beer and fell asleep before the ending. Lock got up and turned off the television. In the darkness, he pulled a blanket blindly from a closet and draped it over her prone body, then went back for a pillow. Gently lifting her head, he placed it underneath. He sat down on the edge of the couch, and she moaned slightly before flipping over. He pulled the hair from her face, leaned down, and kissed her gently on the cheek.

“Good night, Cleopatra,” he whispered, using a nickname from the old days. Sophie would declare herself to be the great Queen Cleopatra and give him orders. “We march on Ireland!” she’d announce, and Lock would explain that Ireland was nowhere near Egypt. But it didn’t matter to her highness, and in the end they’d march on Ireland. Those days were long past, before he’d gone away, and Dennis had stolen his family from him.

He got up and, without thinking, took the three strides required to cross the living room. He sat down at his desk and turned his laptop toward the window so the light wouldn’t bother Sophie. Not that it mattered. Lock was certain that Sophie could sleep through a rhinoceros charging into a drum set. He tapped a key on the keyboard to wake the machine up, and it sprang to life with a quiet hum and a sudden burst of light. His fingers flew across the keys and traced strange hieroglyphics onto the trackpad. His screen flickered and soon he was staring at a Web site telling him that the future was here.

*Won’t hurt to do a simple port scan,* he thought.

<div style="margin-left: 40%">&#968;</div>

Sophie opened her eyes. Her mind was still in the middle of that dream, the one where she was playing in the surf on a sun-soaked beach. She could hear her phone ringing on shore, but she couldn't answer it. Except…that wasn't her ringtone, exactly, and why couldn't someone just answer it?

Gradually, she recognized the beeping sound—the alarm on her phone was going off. She sat up, looked around the living room, inhaling sharply. There was her dad, his head on his desk, three empty cans of Coke lined up to one side, two Pop-Tart wrappers on the other, his laptop screen full of those strange windows of cryptic text that meant he’d been programming. The alarm hadn’t even made him stir. She found her phone in her purse, which was sitting on the beanbag next to the couch. She reached in, turned it off, and lay back on the couch, closing her eyes, inviting sleep to reclaim her. But that wouldn’t do any good—her next alarm would just go off ten minutes later. She could turn *that* off, but she knew by the time she managed it, she’d be awake. Dennis had given her the idea, which had seemed silly to her at first. What if that hadn’t worked, do you set *three* alarms? Four? Where does it end? But she’d tried it anyway and found that just the process of thinking about it seemed to wake her up enough that there was no point in trying to go back to sleep.

She stumbled over to the desk where her father slept. *That can’t be comfortable for him,* she decided. It had been a long time since he’d fallen asleep like that. “All-nighters,” he called them. As in, *I’m too old to still be doing these all-nighters.* “Dad?” she whispered. “Dad? Wake up.”

Nothing. Not even the usual mumbling. She’d try again in a bit. Otherwise, she’d be taking the bus to school—and she *hated* taking the bus to school. Because it wasn’t the school bus, it was the city bus, which stank, and crazy people would sit down next to her and start complaining about how the stock market was like roaches in your grandmother’s bathroom, or that they knew, they *knew*, but never explained what it was they knew. Hopefully, he’d wake up. She could always shake him awake, but if he was *that* tired…well, maybe she should just let him sleep. Even if it meant taking the city bus.

She ate breakfast—her dad always had Pop-Tarts, which was one of the few things that she liked about staying over at his place. On the other hand, he did *not* wake up early and hand her a steaming mug of coffee when she woke up, with a splash of cream and lots of sugar, the way Dennis did, so that sort of canceled out. She settled for a warm Coke instead. She showered, dressed, repacked her backpack, slung it over her shoulder, and approached her father, considering her predicament. “Dad?” she whispered again. “Dad?”

He was snoring lightly. She could raise her voice and see if that worked. But she decided just to let him sleep. She’d deal with the pungent smells and the crazy talk for twenty minutes. And she’d give him a hard time about how he made her take the city bus to school. She smiled mischievously to herself and quietly made her way out the front door.

<div style="margin-left: 40%">&#968;</div>

Lock woke suddenly when the edge of the sun crept past the side of the window next to his desk, dramatically increasing the brightness of the light in the living room. He wiped the drool from his chin and blinked. Sophie was gone. He grabbed his phone and checked the time. It was almost nine o’clock. He rubbed his face in his hands and thought about the pleasant dream he’d been having. He couldn’t quite remember...

Ah. That’s right. They were in Hawaii…he had a house on the ocean…and Sophie lived with him. It was a beautiful, wandering house, with a stairway down to the beach. They had been sipping from coconuts, and Sophie had been building a sandcastle. She was the Sophie from the old dreams, the dreams he’d had while he was away…

Lock fixated on the laptop screen in front of him. What was going on there? All the terminal windows, the scrolling text…he focused his eyes. The password cracker. He was running a password cracker. Actually, many of them in parallel. He looked closer.

Someone with the email of *ccarraby* had chosen a weak password. He now had access to their email. If he was lucky, someone had emailed an SSH key. That was unlikely—CoTech was apparently—and entirely unsurprisingly—very security conscious. Still, it was a start. It was like untangling a ball of yarn. You just started pulling on a stray thread to see what happened.

His mind wandered back to the dream.

For two million dollars, he could get that place in Hawaii. Or something like it anyway. And Dennis could put that in his pipe and smoke it. The hell with a mere two weeks. How about *living there*? Sophie would love that. She’d love it so much, she’d live with her dad again.

That’s how it was supposed to have been.

That’s how it could be again.

#### Southbank, Singapore • Vipul's Apartment

#### Monday, January 22nd

#### Noon SGT (Singapore Time)

Vipul had decided to indulge himself. After all, the road trip began next week. He sat cross-legged on an enormous couch, his red and yellow Singapore cricket team tracksuit standing in sharp contrast to the cream-colored upholstery. He leaned forward over the chess set in front of him and moved one of the few pieces that remained on the board, setting it down with a solid *thunk*. Next to the board was a small laptop with a picture of a chessboard on-screen. Vipul studied it for a moment before straightening up and extending his arms to stretch. Through the great wooden doors that led to his bedroom, he could see two of his favorite prostitutes, still sleeping, tangled up in the sheets of his oversized bed. The midday sunlight filtered in through the blinds behind, lending a soft glow to the pristine Ceylon ironwood floors. A small dish of crumbs and an empty espresso cup remained as evidence of a light breakfast, which had been served earlier by his butler, Sunil, an aged wisp of a man who had also served his late father, and who had somehow now become attached to Vipul.

He was in the midst of a complex endgame. His opponent, who was somewhere in Australia apparently, had a slight advantage in material, which Vipul had exchanged for position and tempo. The difficulty was that he hadn’t put in the time in the years since leaving college to improve his endgame play. He'd earned his Master rating in a tournament in Boston, but he hadn’t played in a sanctioned tournament in two years. The upcoming road trip promised plenty of idle time to get his game back.

He decided to continue to be aggressive with his pawns, to keep the pressure on his opponent, forcing him to react to the threat of promotion. He played the move on the board, savoring the heavy feel of the piece. He’d have to use a smaller board while traveling. This is why he hated traveling—so many luxuries had to be left behind. Even the butler was too old to travel.

Vipul made the same move on the computer so his opponent could see it and respond, and then sat back on the couch, unfolding his legs, and staring back into his bedroom. He could bring the girls, but that involved additional complications. It was a business trip, after all, and he needed to be sharp.

Much like a chess game, every phase of his plan was equally important. As important as it was that they recruit an engineer to clone the Wave Nine, it was just as important to establish a network of private partnerships with brokers throughout Asia. The scale and reliability of that network was the limiting factor of his entire plan. The larger the network, the more the potential for profit; but the larger it got, the harder it was to ultimately collect—and the more likely it was that law enforcement might catch on to its existence.

Thus, the brokers had to be trustworthy, yet also comfortable doing business with the Rathod family. Fortunately, over the decades, the family had cultivated dozens of partnerships, and Vipul had been able to put together a list of candidates that they’d already worked with or came highly recommended.

The laptop beeped, and Vipul leaned forward to see his opponent’s response. Just as he’d hoped, Black had been forced to react. The problem now was that he could only keep tempo for three more moves. After that, he’d have to play defense. Frowning, he leaned over the laptop to offer a stalemate.

The upcoming trip would effectively be a whirlwind tour, beginning in the Rathod stronghold of Bihar, India, and culminating in southeast China and Hong Kong. In each city, they would meet with candidates and attempt to establish an investment partnership. He had three assistants back at his office scheduling appointments, sometimes as many as six in a single day, from seven in the morning until seven at night, including weekends if possible.

The laptop beeped again. The stalemate had been refused. Vipul pulled back away from the laptop, mildly offended. He looked over at the chess board. What had he missed? He knew he couldn’t win, and he’d been sure he could defend against Black’s potential attacks. But Black apparently felt otherwise. He leaned forward, looking down at the board. After a moment, he turned it around slowly. If Black had an attack in mind, it would have to involve some imaginative use of his remaining rook...

Vipul became gradually aware that one of the girls had emerged from the bedroom, draped in a sheet. He looked up to see Liu, her severe looks softened by half-opened eyes, tangled hair, and the filtered sunlight. She curled up next to him on the couch and placed her head awkwardly on his shoulder. She’d broken his concentration, and the clock on the game was running. He would definitely have to leave the girls behind. This trip was too important to get distracted. He’d gambled everything to redefine his family’s legacy and, ultimately, to help India take her place among the great nations of the world.

He pushed Liu aside and refocused on the game in front of him. She whimpered before getting up and calling irritably for Sunil. Vipul’s mind wandered as he stared at the board, fragments of his father’s endless lectures playing in his head. He could see the old man’s immaculately groomed salt-and-pepper beard and the mole under his left eye. *The world is changing Vipul*, he would say. *We must change with it.* The old man wanted to get out of narcotics, gambling, and prostitution, and into what he called *legalized crime*. But even his father would not have understood what he was doing now. He would never have approved of his deal with Li Mun — but Satish would have killed *him* if he hadn’t struck first! — and he wouldn’t have understood the implications of the Wave Nine.

There it was. Black was planning to *sacrifice* the rook to gain tempo. And it was a forced move on top of that, because not taking the rook would lead to a checkmate. In his eagerness to stay on the offensive, he’d missed it. Surely, though, there was still a way to win, or at least gain a stalemate. His single bishop was useless, except as something for his king to hide behind. Perhaps he could force a stalemate that way...

His mind wandered again. Maybe his father wouldn’t have approved of his methods, but he would certainly appreciate his objective. With the Rathod family possessed of incalculable power and influence, he could help lead not just his family but all of India into that new world. He looked down at the wood floors, toward the gurgling fountain in the corner, and over into the kitchen where Sunil was making espresso for the girls, both of whom were now awake and wearing the expensive silken robes he’d bought for them. He’d lived a life of luxury that was literally unimaginable to most people in India. He understood poverty viscerally because his family had forged it like a great sledgehammer, offering a better life to those who were willing to do whatever was asked of them. And he understood it intellectually, having studied the work of economists like Amartya Sen and Kaushik Basu.

All his life he’d concealed his true horror at the source of his family’s power, and of the depth and scale of India’s poverty. Even his father hadn't known his true feelings. He’d grown accustomed to luxury and learned to mingle with the elites without ever forgetting the sight of the illegal shanty towns that arose near every running factory, the open sewers, the cripples deformed by leprosy, the gangs of bony children in rags.

The sledgehammer had served its purpose—it had produced him. And now it was time for him to redeem his family…and make his father proud.

Vipul made a quick move to position his bishop properly and leaned back again, spreading his arms out on the couch. He’d allow himself some more time with the girls this afternoon, and that would be it. From that point on, for the next several months, he would be completely focused on his mission. He would be well rested and prepared. He was ready.

The laptop beeped. Vipul leaned forward. Black was offering a stalemate. Vipul grinned in satisfaction and accepted. He hadn’t won, but he’d played a difficult endgame correctly and avoided a loss. He was getting his form back from his college days. He stood up and stretched again, this time with his entire body, getting up on the tips of his toes. He came back down and gestured to the bedroom.

“Let’s go, girls,” he called. “Back to bed.” The girls cheered and giggled, as they were being paid to do, and headed toward the bedroom.

“Do you need anything, sir?” asked Sunil, who was in the middle of some sort of culinary operation in the kitchen that presumably the girls had instigated.

Vipul turned at the great doors, preparing to close them behind him. “No, Sunil. Why don’t you…sit down for a while. Rest.”

“Thank you, sir.”

“It’s nothing,” said Vipul. He closed the doors with a satisfying *whump* and eyed the girls, who were already on the bed, with their legs folded neatly underneath them, looking up at him expectantly. “Take good care of me, girls,” he instructed. “After this, I’ve got to go save the world.”

#### Lafayette Park, Detroit • Lock's Apartment

#### Monday, January 22nd

#### 4:00 p.m. EST (Eastern Standard Time)

The phone was ringing again. Lock didn’t bother to check the display. He was supposed to have been at work an hour ago. What did it matter to him now? He’d be rich soon enough.

He’d compromised the CoTech network. In another two hours, he’d have everything. Or at least everything that was on the network. The only question that remained was whether that was, indeed, *everything*, or at least everything required to build a quantum computer. He returned his gaze to his laptop and began typing. An uneven column of nearly unintelligible text began forming on his screen in front of him, like cigarette smoke.

He found himself sitting in the darkness again. It got dark so damn early this time of year. He got up, flipped on the light in the kitchen, and grabbed another Coke. He thought about dinner. He was out of pizza and Pop-Tarts. And nearly out of Coke. He was getting tired of all three, but he couldn’t stop now. He’d order another pizza and a two-liter Coke.

Half a box of pizza later, the phone was ringing again. Again, he ignored it. The way the magnetic fields were stabilized…the specifications for the diamonds used for their nitrogen-vacancy centers, which made it possible to isolate individual electrons…the process of annealing the diamonds…it was all there.

The phone rang again. And again.

<div style="margin-left: 40%">&#968;</div>

A loud knock at the door. Lock opened his eyes. When had he closed them? The light from the kitchen was overpowered by the clouded daylight streaming through his windows. He felt his stomach rumbling with hunger. He got up and went to the door and tried to look through the peephole. His vision was still too blurry to see who it was. “Hello?” he yelled out.

“It’s Kafka. Lock?”

Lock stepped back from the door and opened it. Kakfa stood in the hall, wearing a familiar slate-blue parka with the hood up, and sunglasses. He was bouncing slightly on the balls of his feet.

“What?” asked Lock.

“I…I called you.”

“Yeah, I know.”

“Can I…you know, come in?”

“I’m busy.”

“You need a break.”

“No, I don’t.”

“I know you. I’ve seen you when you get—”

“I’m busy. I’ll call you later.”

Kafka stopped bouncing. “You’re doing it, aren’t you?”

“Doing what?”

“You know. That thing. The two million bucks.”

“What does it matter?”

“It matters because you said you weren’t gonna do it.”

“Yeah? So I changed my mind.”

Kafka looked askance and started bouncing again. “Can I come in?”

“I told you, I’m—”

“You’re busy. Got that.”

“I’ll call you later.”

“Yep.” Kafka turned and headed back toward the elevators.

Lock closed the door and then stood there for a second. He opened it again, but Kafka was halfway to the elevator. Lock could see him turn and look back just as he closed the door again.

He rubbed the sleep out of his eyes. *Time to get back to work.*

#### Corktown, Detroit • Mad Dog's Tavern

#### Wednesday, January 24th

#### 10:00 p.m. EST (Eastern Standard Time)

Lock was exuberant. “And drinks are on me!”

Kafka was worried. “Wait. So did your quit your job? Don’t you close tonight?”

“Vicky!” yelled Lock. She waved at him from the end of the bar. “The usual!” He turned back to Kafka. “Should we get wings?”

“Sure.”

“Vicky! Add wings to that!”

The pair settled into their bar stools. Lock looked up at the picture of old Mad Dog. Then he turned to Kafka. “Hell yeah, I quit my job. And I’m gonna be a millionaire soon.”

“So you took that gig...”

“Yeah. I’ve already got the specs. Kirin gave me a ten-thousand-dollar advance. Cash. So I’m feeling pretty good right now.”

“Ten thousand dollars?” Kafka adjusted his glasses.

“Yeah.” Lock pulled an envelope from his jacket. “Right here. Going to the bank first thing in the morning. But tonight…we’re going to celebrate!”

“That doesn’t really sound like much—”

“Man, that place—”

“—considering the value of what you’ve stolen.”

“—is locked down pretty tight.” Lock smiled. “You mean *borrowed*. It took some doing, though, that’s for sure.”

“Yeah?” asked Kafka.

“It started with a public IP they had for a wiki, which came up easily enough. After a bit of probing, it turned out to be LightWiki.”

“You were cloaked?”

“Of course. Although it got interesting because I had to run a cluster at one point. I almost forgot to cloak the cluster machines. Anyway, LightWiki has a known exploit in version 3.6, but you have to get a login first. They had some names on their company Web site, so I picked a few who looked like they were doing non-technical stuff and started composing likely email addresses and sending emails from a dummy address to see which ones bounced. Once I had a few legitimate emails, I ran a simple password dictionary attack against the wiki. Sure enough, I got in pretty quickly.”

“They had everything on the wiki?”

“No, no. It was a lot harder than that.” Both men leaned back in their bar stools a bit as Vicky showed up with their beer. “Hey, Vicky,” said Lock.

Vicky smiled. “Hey, Lock. You look like you’re in a good mood.”

“I am. You wanna go to Vegas tonight?”

“I would, but I’m working.” Vicky gave him a wink. “Your wings will be up in minute.” She headed to the other end of the bar.

Kafka eyed Lock disapprovingly. “You know the rule.”

“I know, I know. But I’m pretty sure she likes me.”

“You’ve got plenty of other options. Anyway…you got into the wiki?”

“Right. Where was I?”

“You got into the wiki.”

“Ah. Once I was in, I was able to use the exploit in 3.6, just a simple script-injection attack, and dumped basically the whole wiki to my laptop. That gave me more emails and a list of internal servers. *And* the IP of a jump box.”

“A jump box?”

“Yeah. They use that to get into the internal engineering network.”

“Ah, right.”

“It was right there in a welcome page for new engineers. I figured all the really useful stuff was on that network. But the only port open was SSH.”

“So you needed to get a key.”

“Right. I hacked into their wireless router—”

“How’d you do that?”

“The sysops guys had a page on the wiki that had the main router password.”

“That was stupid.”

“So was using an old version of the wiki software.”

“I thought you said it was locked down pretty tight.”

“Well, it *was*. Just not tight enough to keep *me* out. And I still didn’t have access to the jump box yet.”

“Whatever. So you got into the router.”

“Yeah. But I wasn’t on the internal network yet. I could see traffic coming and going, but not traffic *within* the network. Which is where the jump box was.”

“Okay...”

“*But* the wireless router itself still had the guest account enabled.”

Kafka took a sip of beer. “Beautiful.”

“So then I could monitor traffic within the network. I focused on just the engineers, which was easy to do because they kept accessing the jump box, for which I already had the address. I ran probes against their machines and found a couple of different vulnerabilities. Two of them were running iTunes—”

“Oh boy.”

“*Yeah*. So pretty quickly I was able to gain access to their machines, which had the SSH keys I needed. I logged into the jump box and then started watching traffic from there. That gave me the addresses of a bunch of other machines. I probed each to get the distros and then wrote a quick crawler to pull everything that wasn’t standard for the distros or known packages. Which wasn't hard because it's basically just piping the output of a file audit to SCP.”

“Right. So then you’d have all the files from the engineering network.”

“Indeed. I still needed to Torrent cracked versions of a couple of CAD packages, Microsoft Office, things like that, so that I could actually *read* the files. But, yeah, I got everything. I also pulled all the source code. I spent a day looking through it all. It was fascinating. There’s a few things I don’t quite understand. There was a long argument captured in an IRC transcript about whether a secondary electrical field was necessary to—well, that’s a whole different discussion—anyway, it was hard to tell what the outcome had been. I looked again through the CAD drawings. It seemed they’d somehow avoided the need for the secondary electrical field, but I don’t quite understand how. Either that, or the CAD drawings are out of date.”

“Wings, boys!” announced Vicky.

“Thank you, Vicky,” said Kafka, looking at Lock with an arched eyebrow.

“Yes, thank you, baby,” agreed Lock, giving Vicky a wink.

Kafka rolled his eyes. “So…do you have enough to actually build the damn thing? Because that would be really fucking cool if you did.”

“I think so.” Lock took a savage bite from a chicken wing. “I guess I’m about to find out.”

#### East Detroit • The Lab

#### Thursday, January 25th

#### 10:00 a.m. EST (Eastern Standard Time)

Kirin’s black Mercedes SUV pulled up in front of a three-story red-brick building, the base of which was covered in half-hearted graffiti. Behind them was an overgrown field. To one side was a parking lot, and to the other, a boarded up home that looked like a strong wind might blow it down.

“I suppose it doesn’t look like much. But there’s lots of space, and it was cheap. The first floor’s just about ready,” Kirin informed him.

Lock got out of the car and followed Kirin across the icy concrete toward a pair of rusty metal doors. There was a chain looped through the handles and an opened padlock dangled from one end. Kirin still wasn't wearing an overcoat and nearly slipped twice on the ice in his leather-soled Italian loafers. The chain rattled as he opened the door. “Of course, Raj and Sanjay are already here.”

The doors creaked open. Lock walked in first, his eyes adjusting to the darkness.

“It’s the second door on the right,” said Kirin. Lock took a few tentative steps forward. The floor was dirty and the paint had nearly peeled off the walls. Kirin walked past him and then stopped farther up and swung open another door. “We’re going to install a keycard system next week. But for now…it’s not like there are other tenants or anything.”

“You bought the whole building?”

“Real estate in Detroit...” began Kirin, shrugging.

“I didn’t mean to put you out. I didn’t know you had another place already lined up.”

“No, no, it’s fine. We should have thought to get something closer to your apartment. Come on in.” Kirin gestured with his still-gloved hand.

Lock walked into a large room with fifteen-foot ceilings and a row of windows spanning the outer walls. The floors had been washed and painted, and the walls had been completely stripped down to the bare brick. Large metal columns rose up to the ceiling every forty feet or so, like great trees in a strange brick-and-metal garden. In one corner were three desks and a work table, along with a small stack of routers and computers, with tiny red and green lights glowing and flickering. A sinew of cables bound together with ties ran up and into a pipe that disappeared into the wall. 

Two men wearing dress shirts and khakis turned from their desks and stared at him expectantly. The first had glasses and curly black hair, and the second had very round eyes and was, unbelievably, wearing sandals.

Kirin walked toward the corner with the desks, which seemed overwhelmed by the scale of the room. Lock decided that they could set up a nice BMX pipe without disrupting the office area in the least. “These are your assistants,” Kirin was saying. “Rajender and Sanjay. Rajender will help you with the more technical tasks. Sanjay is here to help you with other things. Errands. Ordering parts. Whatever you need.”

Lock stepped forward to shake their hands, but both men looked at him as though he was holding a knife. Then the first one, with the glasses, relaxed and extended his hand. “I’m Rajender,” he said. “You can call me Raj.”

The second one did the same. “I’m Sanjay.”

“Nice to meet you,” said Lock sincerely. They seemed like nice enough people. The sandals were a bit strange, but they both looked earnest enough. When Kirin had told him he’d have assistants, he’d been a bit worried. What if he couldn’t trust them? What if they weren’t able to keep up with him? But between actually seeing the office and meeting Raj and Sanjay, Lock’s mind was at ease. This was workable. It might even be enjoyable.

“What do you think?” asked Kirin, who was obviously pleased with himself. “They’re still working on things. Like I said, we’ll have the keycard system in place next week. We’re upgrading to fiber for the network. We’re already rated for all the power you asked for, so that isn’t an issue. The heating system is in need of some maintenance but—”

“It’s fine, Kirin. It’s great, actually. The only thing…I see the servers. That’s my new laptop, I take it? Okay. But…where is the rack?”

Kirin looked sharply toward Raj and Sanjay. Lock immediately regretted asking.

“I ordered it and it was supposed to be here today,” said Sanjay quickly. “I will call the supplier right away and find out why it isn’t here already.”

“It’s fine, it’s fine,” said Lock, eyeing Kirin warily. “I was just curious…it’s not crucial right away.” He had more questions, but he didn’t want to cause trouble for his new assistants. He turned to Kirin. “I think we’re good.” He rubbed his hands together. “I’m ready to get to work.”

Kirin smiled and spread his arms. “Wonderful. We are eager to see what you can do.”

#### Renaissance Center (Detroit Riverfront) • Coach Insignia Restaurant

#### Friday, January 26th

#### 11:00 p.m. EST (Eastern Standard Time)

Lock picked up Samantha at her apartment in Roseville at 7:30 sharp and took her out to Coach Insignia on the seventy-second floor of the RenCen. It was the first time in over a year he’d been on date, longer than that if you didn’t count going out to The Firehouse or Steve’s Soul Food with Mandy. She certainly hadn't. 

He’d met Samantha two nights earlier at Mad Dog’s while celebrating his advance. He remembered Kafka telling every one of the few people who were at the bar on a Wednesday night that Lock was going to be rich. In hindsight, that didn't seem like such a good idea, but it had somehow culminated in Kafka forcing Lock to promise to “take her” — meaning Samantha — “someplace nice.” And so here they were.

Samantha was attractive enough, thought Lock, although he wasn’t usually big on dye-job blonds. She had chubby cheeks, but it worked for her, especially when she smiled. The problem was that they didn’t seem to have anything to talk about, and Lock couldn’t stop thinking about how easy it had been for him and Mandy to talk. He’d never taken her to a nice place like this. Or anyone, really. Maybe things would loosen up after a few glasses of wine. Or perhaps he’d splurge on a good whiskey.

Lock ignored the first three phone calls. With the fourth, he whispered an apology to Samantha, who was staring into her freshly delivered glass of wine as though perhaps she might be able to dive in and swim away. Lock grabbed his phone and turned toward the window. The city of Windsor, laced and shimmering with white and gold electric light, beckoned from beyond the dark chasm that was the Detroit River. There was only one reason his ex-wife would keep calling like that—if something had happened to Sophie. “What’s up?”

“Lock,” replied Karen. “Thank God. Is Sophie with you?”

“No.”

“She isn’t?”

“No.”

“Oh God, Lock. I’m freaking out. I don’t know where she is.”

The gears in his gut begin to grind. “She’s not answering her phone?”

“No.”

“What about Krista?” asked Lock, referring to Sophie’s best friend.

“She isn’t either.”

“When did you see her last?”

“This morning. When she left for school. Krista always comes to pick her up.”

“Okay. Uh...” Lock heard a voice in the background.

“Dennis thinks I should call the police.”

“Jesus. Uh...”

“I’m freaking out here, Lock.”

“Yeah, me too. I mean, it’s probably nothing, right? She’s probably fine. But…just in case.”

“Okay. I’m going to call the police.”

“All right.” Lock hung up the phone.

Samantha was sitting up, looking at him intently. “Is everything okay?”

Lock ran his fingers across the stubble that was forming on the top of his head. “No. Well, probably. But…no. Sophie’s missing. Or not answering her phone.”

Samantha arched her eyebrows. “Sophie?”

“My daughter.”

“Oh. I—”

“Let me think.” Lock closed his eyes.

“Sure, sure, I’m sorry,” said Samantha hastily, shrinking back into her glass of wine.

Lock could hear Kirin’s voice. *Think of your daughter. Think of her future. Her security.* He picked up the phone and dialed. He heard Kirin’s voice answer on the other end. It sounded unusually deep. “Hello, Lock.”

“Hey, Kirin.” Lock suddenly felt foolish.

“What can I do for you?”

“Uh…I don’t know where my daughter is.” Lock cringed.

“Your daughter? I’m sorry to hear that.”

“You don’t, uh—no, of course not. I’m sorry to bother you.”

“It’s quite all right. I’m sure she’s fine.”

“Yeah. Thanks.”

“Good night,” said Kirin. Lock clicked off and stared out the window.

“Can I make a suggestion?” asked Samantha, after a moment.

“Sure, please,” said Lock, who began thinking about how to wrap up their date as gracefully as possible.

“Is Krista her friend?”

“Yeah.”

“And you’ve called Krista, right?”

“Yeah,” said Lock, pursing his lips and tapping his hand lightly on the table.

“Can you call Krista’s parents?”

“No. I don’t have the number.”

“Do you know where they live?”

“Well…yeah…I’ve picked her up and dropped her off a few times.”

“Maybe you should just drive over there.”

Lock stared at her for a moment. “You’re right.”

<div style="margin-left: 40%">&#968;</div>

Lock stood at the front door, feeling stupid again. It was nearly midnight. He was probably going to wake everybody up. On the other hand, if Sophie was really missing…he knocked on the door and shivered and waited.

*Krista’s parents are doing all right,* he thought. This place was almost a big as Karen and Dennis’s new place. He looked back to his beat-up Ford truck and saw Samantha peering out of the driver’s-side window, looking on with interest. He turned and knocked again. He heard voices and footsteps and bolts and chains coming undone. The door opened and a sleepy-looking man in University of Michigan sweats opened the door, standing two heads taller than Lock. “Yeah?”

“I’m sorry to bother you,” began Lock, realizing the stoop was lower than the doorway. “I don’t think we’ve met…I’m Sophie’s dad.”

“Yes, Sophie.” He offered his hand and Lock shook it. “Is everything okay? Did you need to talk to her?”

“I’m sorry?”

“Did you need to talk to Sophie?”

“Uh, she’s here?”

Krista’s father just stared at Lock for a moment. “That’s why you’re here, right?”

“We weren’t sure where she was...”

He gave a knowing smile. “My name’s Dylan,” he offered.

“Lochan. But people call me Lock.”

“I’ll get Sophie for you,” said Dylan. “Come on in.” He turned in the direction of a stairwell behind him.

“No, no, that’s fine, Dylan. Thank you.” Lock half turned back toward the street and then turned back again. “No need to wake them. We’ll get the full story tomorrow, I’m sure.”

Dylan faced the door again. “You sure?”

“Yeah.” Lock began to back toward the street again.

“Well…it was nice to meet—”

“Actually, if you wouldn’t mind...” Lock had turned back yet again and taken a step toward the door. “Can I just…I’d just like to check on her. I know it probably sounds silly—”

“Not at all. Come on in.”

“I don’t really want to wake her or anything. I just want to...”

Dylan put his arm on Lock’s shoulder. Even on a level surface, Dylan’s height made Lock feel like a little kid. “No problem.”

Lock stopped in the doorway and motioned to Samantha. *One minute.*

The two men went up the stairs where they were met by Krista’s mother, Kara, whom Lock had met before—except her hair hadn’t been falling in her face, and she hadn’t been wearing a faded blue bathrobe. Whispered greetings were exchanged and the three parents made their way down a long hallway to a room with a closed door, upon which was hung a stenciled sign that read “Krista’s Room.”

Dylan knocked at the door. “Krista?” he whispered. When there was no answer, he cracked the door open a few inches, then motioned Lock forward.

Lock stepped into the bedroom. In the shaft of light from the hall, he could see the shape of the girls’ bodies lying side-by-side on the bed. He recognized Sophie’s backpack on the floor next to the bed. He took another step into the room, letting his eyes adjust to the darkness. He felt Dylan standing beside him.

He heard Krista’s voice. “Dad?”

“Hey, sweetie. Sophie’s dad is here. He didn’t know where she was.”

Sophie’s voice was next. “Dad?”

“Heya, kiddo. Sorry to wake you. We didn’t know you were staying over here.”

“Seriously? I told Mom this morning before I left for school.”

“Well, you know…and then you didn’t answer your phone.”

Lock heard the sound of a deep sigh. “My battery died.”

“Okay. It’s fine. I just wanted…good night, Cleopatra.”

“Good night, Dad.”

Lock turned to leave the room. “Cleopatra?” he heard Krista asking, as Dylan closed the door.

<div style="margin-left: 40%">&#968;</div>

Lock got in the car and put it in drive. “She was there the whole time.”

“That’s good.”

“Her phone was dead.”

“Did you call Karen?”

“Shit. No. I’ll call her right now.” Lock fished his phone out of his pocket. “Hey, Samantha?” he said, looking at her from the corner of his eye.

“Yeah?”

“Thank you. And…sorry to end our date like this.”

Samantha smiled and placed her hand on his. “It’s okay. This is more important.”

#### Singapore Financial District

#### 10:00 a.m. SGT (Singapore Time)

Katya looked down at Anson Road, twenty-two floors below, bristling with cabs and commuters. She raised her gaze to the building directly across the street, at the offices of a certain South China Finance Group, LLC, the sole officer of which was one Vipul Rathod. The reflected morning sunlight made it difficult to look directly at the buildings, and the windows were tinted anyway. She couldn’t see the people working inside.

But she could hear them.

She turned to the lone desk, which had come with the office she had rented only the day before. The office hadn’t, however, come with the laptop, radio scanner, antenna, or telescopic camera equipment. Katya sat down in front of the laptop and went through a few of the conversations displayed on her screen. She allowed herself a small smile.

She was up and running on Vipul Rathod.

Of course, she still wasn’t precisely certain *why*. She heard Haruo’s voice in her head, something that happened all too often. *There’s nothing to understand, Katya. That’s exactly the problem.* As far as she knew, Haruo had no more background on the Rathod family than she did. They’d never come into play in their current investigation into Triad influence on otherwise friendly governments. Which meant, whatever clues Haruo had zeroed in on, they were about Li Mun.

Her gaze wandered to the large radio antenna by the window where cell signals were channeled and then sent through a radio scanner, which picked out individual texts and conversations and fed them into her laptop. From there, the voice data was converted so that everything was in the form of text. Then it was indexed to make it easy to search for key words and phrases. In turn, that would help her piece together the meanings of the various argot and codes that Vipul and his organization used to communicate.

She wondered if Haruo appreciated her work on the Triad. She was only a small part of a much larger investigation, but she was getting results. And she was so much better at this than she had been when she first started, so much better than most of the field agents out there. But it seemed all anyone noticed was how *long* it took to get results. Haruo always wanted more, sooner. She appreciated the fact that he pushed her. But a pat on the back might be nice once in a while, too.

Her gaze wandered further over to the telescopic camera, which was recording video of everyone who came in and out of the building or the attached parking lot. The angle wasn’t perfect, but with the cooperation of Ong Goh, it would allow her to identify members of the Rathod organization and then correlate those with cell phone conversations. That would help provide context. With any luck, in a few months she’d be able to understand some crucial fraction of what they were saying to each other at any given time.

In addition to remote cameras set up outside Vipul’s apartment and near buildings in Little India—which, she’d noted, were frequented by known members of the Rathod organization—she had covered all the basics. Renting this office was probably pushing her luck, especially given the rent she was paying. Or, rather, that the Agency was paying. But without it, she’d have no coverage of their cell phones—this was the only place she could pick out the radio signals clearly enough. There were no buildings close enough to Vipul’s apartment building, and setting up in Little India would have required the cooperation of a local business. She’d work on developing a reliable source there, but for now this would have to do.

Quartan would probably gripe about her expense reports. He always did. Well, he didn’t gripe about them, exactly. He just asked questions. Sometimes just one question. But he had an uncanny ability to find the one mistake she’d made. Which was why it had gotten to the point where she was hearing his voice in her head all the time.

Her smile faded. What was she doing here? It had been hard enough getting noticed for her work on the Triad case. Now Haruo had her watching someone who wasn’t even a secondary subject of *any* investigation. She’d checked. And these things dragged on. She’d been on Li Mun for two years. How long would she be running on Vipul Rathod? Her plan had always been to move to analysis after she had some experience in the field. She hadn’t wanted to just be some poli-sci geek with lots of vague theories about the way the world worked. But that was ten years and six investigations ago. She had learned plenty. It was time to go home, sit behind a desk, and start a normal life. Get a townhouse in DC, a dog, maybe even start dating.

*Enough whining, Katya.* They still hadn’t turned the minister. And she could still learn plenty from Haruo. And if he thought watching Vipul would yield results, there was surely a good reason for it. Something to do with Li Mun. Unless—

She stood up and walked to the window. Haruo did have *some* background on Vipul—the background she’d given him, that she’d gotten from the SPF. Was there something revealing enough in *that* to justify setting up on him? She reviewed the salient facts in her head. Younger son. Sent off to Oxford and Harvard. Father sets him up running a finance company of some kind. Probably handles the money-laundering, but it’s definitely removed from the day-to-day of the family business. Father dies. Younger son forges an alliance with the Triad and has his older brother killed, a move that, on the face of it, could only serve to weaken the family, especially given Vipul’s lack of experience in its principal operations.

She began to see what Haruo was seeing. Maybe it *wasn’t* just a power play. Maybe Vipul had seen some larger opportunity, an opportunity big enough to justify some short-term losses. The kind of opportunity he’d notice as the head of the family’s money-laundering operation, the South China Finance Corporation, with his blue-blood education in finance. An endeavor that he was actually more qualified to lead than his brother, who’d spent his entire adult life learning the ins and outs of organized crime. What if...?

She turned away from the window and leaned against the sill. She felt her heart pounding in her chest. Had she spent so much time apprenticed to Haruo that she was beginning to think like him, to put herself in the shoes of the people she was observing? Vipul was either crazy or he'd had found an opportunity that was bigger than whatever slice of the organized-crime pie his family presently controlled. 

Either way, he was likely to become a factor in the Li Triad’s plans, for better or worse.

#### 7:00 p.m. IST (India Standard Time) 

Swaran Kapoor rubbed his sweaty palms together as awaited his guests. His eyes scanned the room. There was the decanter full of his best scotch, four glasses, the soda gun, and the ice box. The fan was blowing from the back of the room, next to the open window. All his papers were filed, the room had been swept and dusted—

“Good evening, Swaran,” said the young man striding confidently into his office. He was younger looking than Swaran had expected. And smaller. Swaran found himself suddenly aware that his white Oxford button-down was a size too small and that he was sweating inappropriately. A second older, larger man followed the younger one into the room. Swaran felt confident that the older man was capable of killing him effortlessly and without a second thought.

“Good evening, Mr. Rathod,” said Swaran, hoping his accent wasn’t too pronounced. He didn’t get the chance to speak English very often in Mumbai.

“Please,” said his guest, with a wave of his hand. “Call me Vipul. This is my colleague, Anand Vaidyanathan.”

Swaran smiled and nodded. *Colleague.* That was a nice word for it. He gestured to the chair in front of his desk. “Please. May I get you a drink?” He made his way around from behind the desk toward the scotch.

“If you insist,” said Vipul.

He fixed them all drinks, taking a long draw on his while he was still behind them. He handed them out and returned to his desk. Leaning forward, he smiled expectantly.

“Excellent scotch,” offered Vipul. Swaran smiled wider and nodded. So far, the meeting was going well. He felt sure he was making a good impression.

“Let’s get down to business,” said Vipul, and Swaran was again relieved. He was terrible with small talk. “I have some money that I want you to take care of for me. Any and all transactions will be in the name of a partnership that you will establish and, initially, be the sole partner in. The amount is modest—ten thousand dollars—but I expect it to grow quickly based on investments you will make. You will issue me a convertible note in exchange for the ten thousand dollars. This note is a little unusual—are you following me so far?”

“Yes, yes.”

“Excellent. This note is a little unusual in that it has an interesting conversion option. A second partnership, through which I will be loaning you the money, has the option to convert it into shares of the first partnership, the one that you will establish using the ten thousand dollars. This partnership, as I said, will make investments. I will be providing you with, shall we say, guidance, as to your investment strategy, which will help you ensure good results. In fact, I expect that your results will outperform the nominal rate of the note quite easily. You yourself will retain ten percent ownership of the corporation, after conversion. This, in effect, represents your commission. Understand?”

Swaran swallowed hard. He was suddenly quite lost. He looked over at Anand, who was certainly considering different ways to kill him right then and there. It sounded like he was being asked to borrow money. Except he wasn’t being asked at all. Borrowing money at “nominal” interest from a family like the Rathods was something you did only when you were desperate. Swaran wasn’t desperate. He was eager to curry favor with the Rathods, but he hadn’t expected that borrowing money from them would be the way to do it.

“I can see you’re confused,” observed Vipul. Swaran was paralyzed. He couldn’t read Vipul’s expression at all. And Anand simply looked like an angry stone. “Let me try to clarify,” continued Vipul.

Swaran took another swig of his scotch, no longer bothering to hide his anxiety.

“This is a very good opportunity for you,” Vipul went on amiably. “The guidance I will give you ensures you will be able to generate a substantial return. I have chosen you because you have an excellent reputation here in Mumbai. This is why you get this opportunity instead of someone else. Now—” Vipul paused to take a sip of his scotch, “—you might reasonably wonder, if I am so certain of making money, why am I so eager to take on a partner, even one as respected as yourself? The reason is that I expect the sums of money involved to become too large and too conspicuous for our family to manage. Plainly speaking, it would attract too much attention. Instead, we will divide it up among partners like yourself. Partners with impeccable reputations. Partners we can trust. Now do you understand?”

Swaran could see the outlines of Vipul’s plan forming in his mind, but he was stuck on the simple fact that he was being asked to borrow and, possibly even launder, money from gangsters. Gangsters from Bihar, no less. “I-I think so,” he heard himself stutter.

“Relax,” said Vipul. “Pour yourself some more scotch. Anand? No? I wouldn’t mind another glass, thank you.”

“Certainly, certainly,” said Swaran, moving quickly to pour them both another glass. He nearly dropped Vipul’s. He could feel the warm moisture under his arms. By the time he’d returned to his desk, Vipul had produced a contract and set it in front of him.

“Just take a look. I think you’ll find that everything is just as I’ve told you. Not only that, but you have an out. From the time of the initial trigger, which is the deposit of funds in the partnership’s account, and thereafter, you can convert the note at any time, provided you can buy us out within three business days from the conversion, and our partnership will be concluded. I’m so confident you will be making money from the partnership, that you will want to stay in and remain a partner. Sound good?”

Swaran nodded reflexively, smiling nervously while flipping through the contract. He was looking for the interest rate. Not that a contract was particularly enforceable when dealing with a partner like this one. Nonetheless, the only interest rate he could find was perfectly reasonable. He set the contract down and cleared this throat. “What sort of, uh, return are you expecting?”

Vipul laughed. “You won’t believe it.”

Swaran tried to laugh, but it emerged as more of a wheeze. *Here we go,* he thought. “I mean, fifteen percent annually? Twenty?”

“One thousand-fold over the first week,” said Vipul matter-of-factly.

Swaran stared at Vipul, who still had that same impenetrable expression on his face. Was he joking? Swaran instinctively went for his glass and downed the rest of his scotch. He looked back at Vipul. “So the ten thousand dollars that you give me to start would become...”

“Ten million dollars.”

“After the first *week*?”

“Yes. Precisely.”

Swaran eyed his empty scotch glass.

“Oh, don’t look so frightened, Swaran. It’s called insider trading. The big players do this all the time. We’re just going to join the fun, that’s all.”
